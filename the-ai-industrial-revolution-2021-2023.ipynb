This period is called a \"revolution\" because of the rapid and extensive changes it brought about in manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and transportation. The word \"industrial\" is used because this period was characterized by a shift from manual labor and agrarian society to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing.\n","\n","Just as the Industrial Revolution dramatically altered the fabric of society, a similar phenomenon appears to be unfolding within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer hardware design. Over the past two years, AI has experienced a period of unprecedented growth and advancement,  triggering profound changes in our interaction with machines and their societal impact. Tim Sweeny, CEO of Epic Games and a significant figure in the tech industry, encapsulated this transition in a recent tweet. He stated, \"Artificial intelligence is doubling at a rate much faster than Moore’s Law’s 2 years, or evolutionary biology’s 2M years. Why? Because we’re bootstrapping it on the back of both laws. And if it can feed back into its own acceleration, that’s a stacked exponential\" (Sweeney, 2023). \n","\n","In the tweet he quoted, OpenAI announced the release of an implementation of Consistency Models, a new type of generative model that achieves high sample quality without the need for adversarial training (Song, Dhariwal, Chen, & Sutskever, 2023). This innovation is a significant breakthrough because adversarial training, although powerful, can be computationally demanding and difficult to optimize. The capacity to produce high-quality samples without adversarial training means more efficient learning models and widens the potential for AI usage across diverse fields. This represents another large step forward in AI capabilities and aligns with Sweeny's point about the rapid rate of AI advancement. As AI development then feeds back into its own acceleration by aiding further in hardware development, we may indeed be witnessing what Sweeny describes as a \"stacked exponential\" growth.\n","\n","The expected growth of computing power has traditionally been benchmarked against Moore's law. However, in the last two years we have seen a surge in GPU power that dramatically outpaces this prediction (Moore, 2022). What are the factors driving this rapid pace of innovation? What significant advancements in hardware have been made in the last two years? And what does this acceleration mean for the future of AI development? By exploring this modern 'AI Industrial Revolution,' this essay will delve into the factors fueling AI's rapid evolution and consider the potential implications of this exponential growth."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Theoretical Foundations"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Moore's Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon E.

In 2019 and 2020, several articles, including an influential piece titled 'We’re not prepared for the end of Moore’s Law' (Hoffman, 2020), published in the MIT Technology Review, raised alarm bells about the supposed death of the once-reliable prediction.\n","\n","The chart on the left, taken from the sixth edition of \"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\" by Hennessy and Patterson (2018), suggests a slowing pace in the doubling of transistors.

The chart aligns with recent investigations indicating that the rate of transistor doubling has extended to approximately every 3.5 years, a significant departure from Moore's Law original two-year prediction (Barry, 2023).

For instance, the concept of Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) plays a vital role in processor architecture design. CISC, characterized by a large set of instructions, was prominent during the early days of computing but has since given way to RISC architectures, which prioritize a smaller set of instructions executed more quickly, leading to better power efficiency and performance (Panigrahi, 2023). Most modern CPUs, including those by Intel and AMD, use a hybrid approach, while GPUs and many AI accelerators lean towards RISC.\n","\n","Further, other physical laws and principles also affect computing performance. Dennard scaling, which predicts that power density (energy per unit area) would remain constant as transistors shrink, also reached its limit in the 2005-2006 time period (Platt, 2018). As transistors have become smaller, power leakage has increased, leading to higher power density, increased heat, and reduced performance per watt. This breakdown, often called the \"end of Dennard scaling,\" then shifted the focus towards multi-core and parallel processing designs to continue the trajectory performance improvements.\n","\n","However, multi-core processing designs hit their own roadblock, referred to as Amdahl's law. It states that the maximum improvement in performance due to parallelization is limited by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized. In other words, even with an infinite number of processors, there's a limit to how much speedup you can achieve if any part of your computation must be performed sequentially (Brans, n.d.).\n","\n","Despite the historical accuracy of Moore's law, the recognition of slowing caused many to look to future speedups coming from acceleration and not increased transistor count.

With optimistic expectations for the field's potential, Marvin Minsky boldly proclaimed in a 1970 Life magazine article that within the next three to eight years, machines with average human intelligence would exist. The hype surrounding this forecast ignited an investment wave in the 1970s, which culminated in an AI bubble. However, when this bubble burst in the early 1980s, AI development regressed to the confines of research labs, and the field entered a long-lasting \"AI Winter\" (Jotrin Electronics, 2022).\n","\n","This winter was primarily a result of inadequate computational power and data availability necessary for complex AI model training. During this period, Central Processing Units (CPUs) performed the bulk of computations. CPUs, although efficient at handling a wide array of tasks, were not suited for large-scale AI operations. Furthermore, the algorithms and techniques utilized during this time were still in their infancy, lacking the sophistication and effectiveness of those developed in later years.\n","\n","Moore's Law had been the guiding principle for the advancement of these CPUs. However, the demands of AI computations quickly exceeded the capabilities of these CPU architectures which caused much slower progress than originally anticipated by Minsky. \n","\n","The birth of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) by Nvidia in 1999 marked a significant shift in this trajectory. Initially used to accelerate 3D graphics for PC video games, GPUs offloaded computational work from the CPU, enhancing processing speeds. However, their application in AI model training wasn't recognized until a decade later.\n","\n","In 2009, Geoffrey Hinton recommended using GPUs for model training, and Stanford University researchers Rajat Raina, Anand Madhavan, and Andrew Ng, published a paper illustrating the superior computational power of modern GPUs compared to multi-core CPUs for deep learning. Hinton labeled them as \"the future of machine learning\", but the tipping point came in 2012 when AlexNet, a neural network model developed by Hinton and his student Alex Krizhevsky, won the ImageNet competition with record image recognition accuracy using Nvidia's GPU hardware (Jotrin Electronics, 2022).\n","\n","This marked a paradigm shift, elevating GPUs to the gold standard for AI advancements. It also highlighted how the AI hardware landscape was beginning to accelerate far beyond the incremental advancements predicted by Moore's Law, thereby setting the stage for the next decade of unprecedented growth in AI capabilities.\n","\n","Hardware has since been the silent workhorse in the world of AI, defining the speed and efficiency of both model training and deployment. The choice of hardware can dramatically affect an AI model's learning curve, determining how rapidly it can digest and learn from data. Equally, the hardware used in deployment affects the speed at which these AI models can produce predictions and respond to inputs, a crucial factor in many real-time applications.\n","\n","Even with the greater optimization potential of GPUs, engineers still have to grapple with the challenge of fitting as much as possible into smaller and smaller spaces. In 2016 we see the first instances of AI assisted chip design from companies like Synopsis have been incorporating task specific machine learning models, such as the Fusion Compiler [], using the same Design Space Exploration (DSE) and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) technologies that have been used for decades. Research in this area advanced quietly until both Google and Synopsys created a buzz around AI-powered chip design. \n","\n","On April 3rd, 2020 Google posted a blog post titled 'Chip Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning'. In this short post, they outlined a framework to teach an algorithm how to optimize chip design through a game framework. They made the claim that \"this method is the first chip placement approach that has the ability to generalize\" (Goldie & Mirhoseini, 2020). The AI generated designs are \"comparable or superior\" to humans but can be generated much more rapidly (Vincent, 2021).

AI powered chip design has the power to drastically lower the cost of chip manufacturing and further democratizing the technology to the masses. \n","\n","The November 2022 release of ChatGPT by OpenAI has highlighted the essential role of hardware in driving AI performance. The high-level functionality of ChatGPT demands significant memory and storage capacity. For instance, this system was trained on an extensive network of 10,000 NVIDIA A100 HPC (high-performance computing) accelerators, each of which is a $12,500 tensor core Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) (Kandel, 2023). A case in point is the third version of ChatGPT, which features an astounding 175 billion parameters and calls for a data capacity of 45 terabytes during its training stage.

MLPerf consists of eight benchmark tests: image recognition, medical-imaging segmentation, two versions of object detection, speech recognition, natural-language processing, recommendation, and a form of gameplay called reinforcement learning. MLPerf is often referred to as \"the Olympics of machine learning\" because computers and software from 21 different companies compete on any or all the tests [IEEE]. This incentivizes hardware companies like Nvidia to put their best foot forward.\n","\n","In 2022 an IEEE Spectrum article came out following MLPerf v2.0, the June 2022 benchmark test results, that specifically described the rapid outpacing of AI hardware and training times compared to Moore's law. \n","\n","![](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-shows-six-lines-of-various-colors-sweeping-up-and-to-the-right.jpg?id=30049159&width=1580&quality=80)\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Based on the release of the 2023 MLPerf results, the pace of AI innovation is not only continuing but accelerating at a rate much faster than previously predicted. NVIDIA's AI platform has shown a considerable performance increase over its 2022 results, reaffirming Tim Sweeny's statement that AI is \"doubling at a rate much faster than Moore’s Law’s 2 years.\"\n","\n","In 2022, NVIDIA's AI platform, powered by the A100 Tensor Core GPU, demonstrated significant versatility and efficiency across all eight MLPerf benchmarks. It achieved the fastest time to train on four out of eight tests and was found to be the fastest on a per-chip basis on six out of the eight tests. This performance was attributed to full-stack innovations spanning GPUs, software, and at-scale improvements, delivering 23x more performance in 3.5 years since the first MLPerf submission.\n","\n","![](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLPerf-inference-April-22-FINAL2-1-1536x663.jpg.webp)\n","\n","Fast forward to 2023, the results are even more impressive. The newly introduced NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, designed in part by AI, running on DGX H100 systems, not only achieved the highest performance in every test of AI inference but also saw a performance gain of up to 54% since their debut in September (Salvator, 2023). This unprecedented progress was in part due to NVIDIA's Transformer Engine, a testament to the company's commitment to optimizing software and hardware innovations to push the boundaries of AI performance.\n","\n","![](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/H100-GPU-inference-performance-MLPerf-1536x857.jpg)\n","\n","Specifically, in the healthcare domain, the H100 GPUs have improved performance by 31% since September on the 3D-UNet benchmark, used for medical imaging. Additionally, the H100 GPUs powered by the Transformer Engine excelled in the BERT benchmark, a transformer-based large language model, significantly contributing to the rise of generative AI (Salvator, 2023).\n","\n","Furthermore, the NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs, which debuted in the MLPerf tests, ran over 3x the speed of prior-generation T4 GPUs, demonstrating another significant leap in AI performance.\n","\n","This rapid advancement showcases how technology evolves by \"bootstrapping\" on previous laws, as Sweeny noted. As these technologies accelerate their development, they also enable new levels of efficiency and capabilities that would have been inconceivable in previous years. In essence, these advancements show that we are not only building upon the foundations laid by Moore's Law but are also accelerating beyond it, providing the fertile ground necessary for the exponential growth of AI technologies."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Implications and Consequences of this Accelerated Pace"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["While this accelerated growth in AI brings numerous benefits in fields such as healthcare, finance, climate modeling, and more, it also surfaces pressing questions around the control, understanding, and potential implications of these rapidly evolving technologies. As we stand at the forefront of this technological surge, it's crucial to probe these concerns and address them preemptively.\n","\n","The growth of AI, as Sweeney alludes, follows a pattern of 'stacked exponential acceleration'. This not only implies an extraordinary rate of progress, dwarfing the comparatively linear advancements predicted by Moore's Law or the glacial pace of biological evolution, but it also suggests that AI could potentially reach, or even surpass, human-level intelligence. This is not a proposition to be taken lightly. In the hands of well-intentioned researchers and developers, AI systems with capabilities beyond human intelligence could yield unprecedented advancements and solve some of the world's most challenging problems. However, if mishandled, such powerful systems could pose profound ethical and existential risks.\n","\n","Therefore, as we continue to harness the fruits of Moore's Law and biological evolution in our pursuit of AI advancement, it is imperative that we maintain a vigilant and proactive stance towards its development. This involves putting in place robust mechanisms to regulate and monitor the evolution of these systems, fostering transparency and open dialogue about their potential implications, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are equitably distributed. In this way, we can prevent the unwieldy growth of AI from eclipsing our collective wisdom and instead guide it towards the greater good of humanity.\n","\n","On the other hand, the prospect of AI reaching or exceeding human intelligence, while sobering, also opens up a plethora of exciting possibilities. It encourages us to reimagine the boundaries of what can be achieved, to envision a future where our most intractable challenges have been surmounted, and to redefine what it means to be human in a world where our creations might mirror us in intelligence, or even surpass us.\n","\n","The remarkable growth and development of AI thus underscores the need for us to carefully steward this technology. It's a call for us to apply our collective intelligence and wisdom towards ensuring that AI develops in a way that is beneficial for all of humanity, mitigating the risks and maximizing the benefits. It is, ultimately, a call for responsible and informed evolution of the technology that is redefining our world."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Future Predictions and Conclusion"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Comparing modern hardware benchmarks to Moore's Law, it's clear that while Moore's Law provides a valuable historical context for the evolution of computing power, it doesn't fully encapsulate the multifaceted nature of the explosion in hardware acceleration. Current benchmarks like MLPerf provide a much more nuanced view of this phenomenon, taking into account the complexity of the tasks being performed, the efficiency of the algorithms used, and the intricacies of the hardware and software designs.\n","\n","The unpredictable pace of AI hardware acceleration emphasizes not just the immense potential of the field, but also the critical importance of our ongoing commitment to responsible stewardship. The rise of potent systems like ChatGPT reminds us that what was very recently in the realm of science fiction has indeed become our reality. The blend of awe and concern we experience today highlights our responsibility to manage these technological leaps wisely. The swift rate of AI development, outpacing both Moore's Law and biological evolution, invites urgent dialogues about control, understanding, and potential implications of AI systems that can reach or surpass human-level intelligence. Rather than being passive observers of this rapid acceleration, we must actively shape our relationship with AI, fostering a future where the technology serves humanity's best interests, mitigates risks, and contributes to a more informed, equitable, and innovative world. \n","\n","Going forward, the question is not just how quickly we can double the number of transistors on a chip, but how we can best optimize the entire system - hardware, software, and algorithms - to deliver the most effective performance for the full range of tasks espeically those that revolve around model training. This reflects an overall shift from a focus on hardware alone (as epitomized by Moore's Law) to a more holistic view of computing performance. The future of computing is bright and the current incentives around AI hardware in particular will continue to drive performance innovations at speeds we have not yet experienced in the age of computing."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Sources"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["[1] Dilmengani, C.
