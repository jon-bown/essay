Tim Sweeny, CEO of Epic Games and a significant figure in the tech industry, encapsulated this transition in a recent tweet. He stated, \"Artificial intelligence is doubling at a rate much faster than Moore’s Law’s 2 years, or evolutionary biology’s 2M years. Why? Because we’re bootstrapping it on the back of both laws. And if it can feed back into its own acceleration, that’s a stacked exponential\" (Sweeney, 2023). \n","\n","In the tweet he quoted, OpenAI announced the release of an implementation of Consistency Models, a new type of generative model that achieves high sample quality without the need for adversarial training (Song, Dhariwal, Chen, & Sutskever, 2023). This innovation is a significant breakthrough because adversarial training, a key component of current generative AI methods, can be very computationally demanding and difficult to optimize. The capacity to generate high-quality samples without adversarial training means much more efficient learning models and widens the potential for AI usage across diverse fields. This represents another large step forward in AI capabilities and aligns with Sweeny's point about the rapid rate of AI advancement. With AI's unique ability to contribute to the optimization of its own development, from refining model architectures to enhancing hardware design, it distinctly sets itself apart from traditional computer hardware development. It is this self-augmenting capacity of AI that likely leads to what Sweeny refers to as the \"stacked exponential\" growth.\n","\n","The expected growth of computing power has traditionally been benchmarked against Moore's law. However, in the last two years we have seen a surge in acceleration hardware that dramatically outpaces this prediction (Moore, 2022). What are the factors driving this rapid pace of innovation? What significant advancements in hardware have been made in the last two years? How can we measure the acceleration and what does the acceleration mean for the future of AI development? While it is impossible to cover every development, this essay will explore key advancements in AI hardware over the past two years, delve into the driving forces behind AI's swift evolution, and ponder the potential implications of this accelerated growth."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Theoretical Foundations"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Moore's Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, predicts that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years, or about a ~40% annual increase. This prediction from 1975 was actually a revision from a decade earlier that densities doulbe every year. What Moore himself later described to be just a \"wild extrapolation\" was never really a scientific law but rather an observation of the progress in electronics that would only continue. The physics behind this says simply that as transistors get smaller, they run faster and with less power consumption. The economics then says as you place more transistors in a smaller and smaller area, the transistor is cheaper to make (McKenzie, 2023).\n","\n","Historically, this has been a rough indicator of computational power growth, but it doesn't directly correlate with complex tasks like machine learning model training or inference, where factors like algorithms, data I/O speeds, memory design, and power efficiency also play major roles.\n","\n","As we exited the 2010's, much of the conversation within the computer hardware community shifted towards questioning the sustainability of Moore's Law into the next decade. In 2019 and 2020, several articles, including an influential piece titled 'We’re not prepared for the end of Moore’s Law' (Hoffman, 2020), published in the MIT Technology Review, raised alarm bells about the supposed death of the once-reliable prediction. Another perspective argued that Moore's law is still alive and well, just not with the strictest definition. \n","\n","CPU performance is traditionally measurd in terahertz (THz) while the GPU is measured in trillions of floating point operations per second (TFLOPS). Neural processing units, designed specifically for machine learning applications, measures performance in trillions of operations per second (TOPS). If we only focus on measuring CPU power, we miss out on the full picture. The following chart superimposes the historical processing power of Apple iPhone chips, specically the NPU (referred to as the \"neural engine\" by Apple), with generic GPU and CPU performance. With the NPU specifically, we are seeing over 100% YoY processing power improvements.

This refined depiction of the growth trajectory integrates other factors and laws into its prediction, thus offering a more nuanced understanding of technology progression. The chart aligns with recent investigations indicating that the rate of transistor doubling has extended to approximately every 3.5 years, a significant departure from Moore's Law original two-year prediction (Barry, 2023).

For instance, the concept of Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) plays a vital role in processor architecture design. CISC, characterized by a large set of instructions, was prominent during the early days of computing but has since given way to RISC architectures, which prioritize a smaller set of instructions executed more quickly, leading to better power efficiency and performance (Panigrahi, 2023). Most modern CPUs, including those by Intel and AMD, use a hybrid approach, while GPUs and many AI accelerators lean towards RISC.\n","\n","Further, other physical laws and principles also affect computing performance. Dennard scaling, which predicts that power density (energy per unit area) would remain constant as transistors shrink, also reached its limit in the 2005-2006 time period (Platt, 2018). As transistors have become smaller, power leakage has increased, leading to higher power density, increased heat, and reduced performance per watt. This breakdown, often called the \"end of Dennard scaling,\" then shifted the focus towards multi-core and parallel processing designs to continue the trajectory performance improvements.\n","\n","However, multi-core processing designs hit their own roadblock, referred to as Amdahl's law. It states that the maximum improvement in performance due to parallelization is limited by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized. In other words, even with an infinite number of processors, there's a limit to how much speedup you can achieve if any part of your computation must be performed sequentially (Brans, n.d.).\n","\n","Despite the historical accuracy of Moore's law, the recognition of slowing caused many to look to future speedups coming from acceleration and not increased transistor count."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Historical Context"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The term \"artificial intelligence\" was first introduced by scientists John McCarthy, Claude Shannon, and Marvin Minsky at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. With optimistic expectations for the field's potential, Marvin Minsky boldly proclaimed in a 1970 Life magazine article that within the next three to eight years, machines with average human intelligence would exist. The hype surrounding this forecast ignited an investment wave in the 1970s, which culminated in an AI bubble. However, when this bubble burst in the early 1980s, AI development regressed to the confines of research labs, and the field entered a long-lasting \"AI Winter\" (Jotrin Electronics, 2022).\n","\n","This winter was primarily a result of inadequate computational power and data availability necessary for complex AI model training. During this period, Central Processing Units (CPUs) performed the bulk of computations. CPUs, although efficient at handling a wide array of tasks, were not suited for large-scale AI operations. Furthermore, the algorithms and techniques utilized during this time were still in their infancy, lacking the sophistication and effectiveness of those developed in later years.\n","\n","Moore's Law had been the guiding principle for the advancement of these CPUs. However, the demands of AI computations quickly exceeded the capabilities of these CPU architectures which caused much slower progress than originally anticipated by Minsky. \n","\n","The birth of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) by Nvidia in 1999 marked a significant shift in this trajectory. Initially used to accelerate 3D graphics for PC video games, GPUs offloaded computational work from the CPU, enhancing processing speeds. However, their application in AI model training wasn't recognized until a decade later.\n","\n","In 2009, this understanding began to change, marking a turning point in the AI hardware landscape. Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, recommended the use of GPUs for model training. Simultaneously, Stanford University researchers Rajat Raina, Anand Madhavan, and Andrew Ng illustrated the superior computational power of modern GPUs compared to multi-core CPUs in deep learning applications (Raina et al., 2009). With the foresight of GPUs' potential impact, Hinton boldly labeled them as \"the future of machine learning.\" This marked the beginning of an acceleration in the AI hardware landscape, far surpassing the incremental advancements predicted by Moore's Law.\n","\n","The tipping point arrived in 2012 with the advent of AlexNet, a groundbreaking neural network model developed by Hinton and his student Alex Krizhevsky. Powered by Nvidia's GPU hardware, AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by delivering a record-setting image recognition accuracy (Jotrin Electronics, 2022). This marked a paradigm shift and solidified GPUs as the gold standard in the AI landscape.\n","\n","Yet, the extent of AI's growing computational needs remained unpredictable. According to OpenAI's 2018 analysis, before 2012, using GPUs for machine learning was uncommon, which made the realization of such breakthroughs rare. Between 2012 and 2014, infrastructure to train on multiple GPUs was scarce. Thus, most results involved only 1-8 GPUs, rated at 1-2 TFLOPS. The period from 2014 to 2016 saw the use of 10-100 GPUs, rated at 5-10 TFLOPS, resulting in 0.1-10 petaflop/s-days. However, larger training runs had limited value due to diminishing returns on data parallelism (OpenAI, 2018).\n","\n","The period from 2016 to 2017, however, witnessed a leap in computational efficiency. Methods allowing for greater algorithmic parallelism, such as huge batch sizes, architecture search, and expert iteration, were developed. Coupled with the advent of specialized hardware like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a specialized version of the NPU, and faster interconnects, these developments greatly increased the computational limits, at least for some applications (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018).\n","\n","In the meantime, hardware has become the silent workhorse in the AI world, defining the speed and efficiency of both model training and deployment. The hardware's choice can significantly affect an AI model's learning curve, influencing how quickly it can digest and learn from data. Furthermore, the hardware used in deployment impacts the speed at which these AI models can produce predictions and respond to inputs, a critical factor in many real-time applications.\n","\n","Despite the increased optimization potential of GPUs, engineers are challenged with fitting more capabilities into ever-shrinking spaces. Around 2018, AI-assisted chip design emerged as a solution to this challenge, with companies like Synopsis incorporating task-specific machine learning models, such as the Fusion Compiler. These companies utilized Design Space Exploration (DSE) and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) technologies that have been in use for decades. This area's research advanced steadily until both Google and Synopsys created a buzz around AI-powered chip design, shedding light on the potential of AI in hardware optimization and design.\n","\n","On April 3rd, 2020 Google posted a blog post titled 'Chip Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning'. In this short post, they outlined a framework to teach an algorithm how to optimize chip design through a game framework. They made the claim that \"this method is the first chip placement approach that has the ability to generalize\" (Goldie & Mirhoseini, 2020). The AI generated designs are \"comparable or superior\" to humans but can be generated much more rapidly (Vincent, 2021). Synopsis later announced DSO.ai, the \"worlds first autonomous AI application for chip design\" (\"Synopsys,\" n.d.). AI powered chip design has the power to drastically lower the cost of chip manufacturing and further democratizing the technology to the masses. A 2021 Forbes article estimated that the chip design process could shrink from 2-3 months to 2-3 weeks (Freund, 2021).\n","\n","To further set the stage for what has been developed over the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 introduced a surge in demand for consumer electronics following several years of delcine (Kaur, 2021). This demand coupled with constraints on supply due to lockdowns and other bottlenecks caused a chip shortage that still continues at the time of writing. Innvoations in semiconductor production have elevated to a much higher priority. The recent surge in AI related hardware has occured despite these many production constraints, but have led to higher costs and more barriers to entry.\n","\n","The November 2022 release of ChatGPT by OpenAI has highlighted the essential role of hardware in driving AI performance. The high-level functionality of ChatGPT demands significant memory and storage capacity. For instance, this system was trained on an extensive network of 10,000 Nvidia A100 HPC (high-performance computing) accelerators, each of which is a $12,500 tensor core Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) (Kandel, 2023). A case in point is the third version of ChatGPT, which features an astounding 175 billion parameters and calls for a data capacity of 45 terabytes during its training stage. This exceeds the memory capabilities of even the most powerful GPUs typically used in system training, necessitating the concurrent operation of multiple processors.

These advancements have unlocked new frontiers in the AI and machine learning landscape, with significant contributions coming from industry powerhouses such as Google, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Apple, and Meta.\n","\n","The late 2022 release of OpenAI's ChatGPT has sparked a surge in AI advancements over the following six months, primarily fueled by an increased demand for advanced GPU hardware. The competitive landscape, featuring key players like Google with their Bard powered by PaLM 2, Microsoft's Bing AI, and Meta's LLaMA, has been driven by the development of large language models (LLMs). Latest AI hardware's power and efficiency is crucial for training large language models (LLMs), broadening their practical uses. However, hardware is just one facet of product development. Choices about parameter and data size critically shape the design, affecting everything from hardware requirements to training duration and model performance. For instance, the implications of choosing 175 billion parameters for OpenAI's GPT-3, 170 trillion for GPT-4, versus LLaMA's 65 billion are considerable.\n","\n","In addition to the most recent advancements in LLMs, we can also look to the most recent developer conferences from Google, Apple, and Microsoft to give us an idea of the types of advancements we are going to see in the latter end of 2023. Google I/O, Microsoft Build, and Apple WWDC are the yearly flagship conferences where developers in particular get a deeper dive into the software and hardware that will launch later in the year. Google and Microsoft are fully embracing and participating in the AI race with new virtual assistants, product features, and open LLMs just to name a few. Apple, a bit more subtle in the AI race, did not once mention the term \"artificial intelligence\" at this years WWDC (Greenburg, 2023). Instead they unveiled numerous software improvements for machine learning across the device ecosystem along with the upgraded M2 Ultra's 32-core neural engine touted as 40% than the prior year 32-core model. (\"Apple introduces M2 Ultra,\" 2023).\n","\n","Google made a giant leap in its Cloud TPU v4, offering a staggering 10x increase in machine learning system performance compared to its predecessor, TPU v3. With innovative interconnect technologies and domain-specific accelerators, the TPU v4 not only amplifies performance, but it also champions energy efficiency, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Notably, the TPU v4 is tailored for LLMs such as LaMDA, MUM, and PaLM, with the PaLM model delivering 57.8% of peak hardware floating-point performance over 50 days of training on the TPU v4 (Jouppi & Patterson, 2022).\n","\n","Nvidia marked a substantial milestone with its Grace CPU Superchips, finding a place in the UK-based Isambard 3 supercomputer. This setup, featuring 384 Arm-based Nvidia Grace CPU Superchips, commands a total core count exceeding 55,000. It delivers FP64 performance within a remarkable power envelope of under 270kW. The incorporation of Arm Neoverse V2 cores offers a high-performance edge, as the Grace chips are projected to have superior speed and memory bandwidth compared to their counterparts (Kennedy, 2023).\n","\n","Intel, with its Meteor Lake chips, embedded Vision Processing Units (VPUs) across all variants, thereby offloading AI processing tasks from the CPU and GPU to the VPU. This move resulted in increased power efficiency and ability to handle complex AI models, providing benefits for power-hungry applications such as Adobe suite, Microsoft Teams, and Unreal Engine (Roach, 2023).\n","\n","AMD introduced an AI chip called MI300X, described as \"the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI\". This introduction is expected to compete head-on with Nvidia's AI chips and generate interest from major cloud providers. Simultaneously, AMD initiated high-volume shipping of a general-purpose central processor chip named \"Bergamo\", adopted by Meta Platforms and others for their computing infrastructure (Mohan, 2023).\n","\n","Meta made its foray into AI hardware by unveiling its first custom-designed chips, the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) and the Meta Scalable Video Processor (MSVP). These chips, optimized for deep learning and video processing, underpin Meta's plans for a next-gen data center optimized for AI, illustrating its dedication to crafting a fully integrated AI ecosystem (Khare, 2023).\n","\n","Although Nvidia currently has 90% AI computing market share, companies like Cerebras, AMD, Intel, IBM, and another startup called Groq are determined to chip away at that lead. Groq is a startup founded by a former Google engineer in 2016 but gained recent attention by claiming that it had created a process to move Meta's LLaMA from Nvidia chips over to its own hardware. The complexity of the current AI hardware makes it a tedious task to adapt model architectures to run quickly on new setups (Lee & Nellis, 2023). \n","\n","While these advancements in 2023 are indeed significant, it's important to note that the AI Hardware Summit for the year is yet to occur, indicating that we don't have the full picture of all the developments in the field for this year. As such, the current state of AI hardware in 2023 should be viewed as a work in progress, awaiting further updates and advancements.\n","\n","In regards to AI chip design, the four major players continue to be Synopsis, Cadence, Google, and Nvidia . Althought there haven't been any significant announcements made this year about a new AI designed chips, there is a shifting sentiment that this movement is going more mainstream due to the increase in customer contracts being reported by Synopsis and Cadence.

This is one reason why more relevant benchmarks like MLPerf are so valuable - they offer a more holistic view of system performance for more relevant tasks.\n","\n","There are several benchmarks that are commonly used today to evaluate the performance of ML/AI hardware specifically. MLPerf is one of the most popular of the last two years (MLCommons, 2023). Developed by a consortium of tech companies in 2018, MLPerf benchmarks measure the speed of machine learning software and hardware.\n","\n","Another benchmark that has gained attention recently is the AI Benchmark, which is designed specifically for AI tasks on mobile devices. This benchmark measures the speed, accuracy, and power efficiency of AI algorithms on various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and dedicated AI accelerators.\n","\n","The Compute Architecture Benchmark Review (CARB) is another initiative that aims to provide clear, consistent performance benchmarks for various computational tasks, including machine learning.\n","\n","However, these benchmarks focus mainly on the operational aspect of machine learning - i.e., how quickly a given piece of hardware can perform a specific task. They do not necessarily reflect the research or development aspect of machine learning - i.e., how quickly a new model can be developed, trained, and optimized.\n","\n","Metrics like time-to-solution or time-to-accuracy are more indicative of the research productivity, which often involves multiple iterations of model development, training, and optimization.\n","\n","Benchmarks such as MLPerf HPC provide insights into the performance of hardware on High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads, which include tasks like weather forecasting, quantum mechanics, and molecular dynamics, along with machine learning tasks."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Comparing the Pace: Moore's Law vs. AI Hardware Growth"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Although MLPerf launched in 2018, it wasn't until the very end of 2020 that it was properly scaled and standardized into the ML Commons consortium.

MLPerf consists of eight benchmark tests: image recognition, medical-imaging segmentation, two versions of object detection, speech recognition, natural-language processing, recommendation, and a form of gameplay called reinforcement learning. MLPerf is often referred to as \"the Olympics of machine learning\" because computers and software from 21 different companies compete on any or all the tests [IEEE]. This incentivizes hardware companies like Nvidia to put their best foot forward.\n","\n","In 2022 an IEEE Spectrum article came out following MLPerf v2.0, the June 2022 benchmark test results, that specifically described the rapid outpacing of AI hardware and training times compared to Moore's law.

As these technologies accelerate their development, they also enable new levels of efficiency and capabilities that would have been inconceivable in previous years. In essence, these advancements show that we are not only building upon the foundations laid by Moore's Law but are also accelerating beyond it, providing the fertile ground necessary for the exponential growth of AI technologies."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Implications and Consequences of this Accelerated Pace"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The accelerated development of AI in the last two years, as suggested by Sweeney's concept of 'stacked exponential acceleration', presents both exceptional opportunities and significant challenges. This notion of rapid advancement not only outpaces the linear progression predicted by Moore's Law and the gradual pace of biological evolution, but also posits that AI could potentially reach, or even surpass, human-level intelligence.\n","\n","This notion sparks a dichotomy of perspectives within the AI community. On one side, individuals such as Geoffrey Hinton and Elon Musk urge caution, highlighting ethical and existential risks. Conversely, optimists like Andrew Ng emphasize the potential of superior AI to drive unprecedented advancements and solve global challenges [source]. However, it is clear that the trajectory of AI's future remains as relevant and uncertain as when pioneers like Samuel Butler and Alan Turing first contemplated it.\n","\n","As Samuel Butler posited in his 1863 essay, *\"It is said that the power of a machine to imitate human skill in any real sense of the words depends on the degree of skill possessed by the designer or constructor, and that unless he knew a thing himself he could not possibly teach it to his machine\"* (Butler, 1863). Alan Turing, in his seminal work on machine intelligence, echoed this sentiment in his 1950 paper: *\"'It is said that these machines can only do what we know how to order them to perform', a rather begging of the question. It might also be said that we can only do what machines will allow us to do, for this is equally true\"* (Turing, 1950).\n","\n","An important consideration in this discourse is the accessibility and cost of AI technologies. Despite the accelerated pace of AI development, it has not directly led to reduced costs, although it has increased accessibility. This indicates that while every individual or organization may not need to train their own AI models, they could leverage trained models to fulfill various use cases.\n","\n","Furthermore, the demand for a robust framework of AI benchmarks continues to grow, prompting the need for innovative ways to measure and predict AI progress. This need is underscored by recent global challenges such as increased demand for GPUs, chip shortages, and fluctuating stock prices of chip manufacturers."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Looking Ahead"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","Comparing modern hardware benchmarks to Moore's Law, it's clear that while Moore's Law provides a valuable historical context for the evolution of computing power, it doesn't fully encapsulate the multifaceted nature of the explosion in recent hardware acceleration. Current benchmarks like MLPerf provide a much more nuanced view of this phenomenon, taking into account the complexity of the tasks being performed, the efficiency of the algorithms used, and the intricacies of the hardware and software designs. The more relevant measures show that not only is Moore's law still relevant but it is in many cases being far outpaced every year.\n","\n","Going forward, the question is not just how quickly we can double the number of transistors on a chip, but how we can best optimize the entire system - hardware, software, and algorithms - to deliver the most effective performance for the full range of tasks espeically those that revolve around model training. This reflects an overall shift from a focus on hardware alone (as epitomized by Moore's Law) to a more holistic view of computing performance. The future of computing is bright and the current incentives around AI hardware in particular will continue to drive performance innovations at speeds we have not yet experienced in the age of computing."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Sources"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Amodei, D., & Hernandez, D.
