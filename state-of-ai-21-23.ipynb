Training and scaling models like DALL-E and GPT-3 require considerable hardware resources, emphasizing processing power, networking capabilities, and high-speed storage. While DALL-E's exact hardware setup remains undisclosed, replicating it on smaller scales reveals the complexity of hardware setup (Cuenca, 2023).\n","\n","### Graphcore\n","In early 2021, Graphcore, a U.K. based chip manufacturer announced its second generation of the Colossus intelligence processing unit (IPU), GC200 Colossus MK2. Each GC200 IPU has 59 billion transistors, 1,472 independent programmable cores, and 250 TeraFLOPS. This level of parallel processing capability was designed to effectively handle the sparsity and irregularity of machine learning workloads, providing a different approach to the more common Nvidia's GPUs (Doherty, 2021).\n","\n","### Cerebras Systems\n","In April, Cerebras Systems, a renowned AI chip startup, relased the WSE-2 the largest chip ever built. This chip boasted 850,000 cores and 2.6 trillion transistors. This capacity more than doubles that of its predecessor, the WSE-1 (Dilmengani, 2023). Cerebras also announced the \"world's first brain-scale\" AI solution. This term stems from the estimate that the human brain has an order of 100 trillion synapses and prior to this existing AI clusters could match about 1% of this. The CS-2 accelerator, the size of a smaller refrigerator, to support models of over 120 trillion parameters in size but is comprised of only one WSE-2 chip (Business Wire, 2021).\n","\n","### Nvidia \n","The Nvidia Grace CPU was also announced in April, the company's first data center CPU, was designed to address the computational requirements of advanced applications such as natural language processing, recommender systems, and AI supercomputing that analyze large datasets. Grace combined energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with a unique low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with remarkable efficiency. This Arm-based processor aimed to provide a ten-fold performance increase for systems training large AI models, compared to leading servers at the time. Notably, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory have plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers to support scientific research efforts (Nvidia, 2021).\n","\n","### Google\n","In May, Google announced the introduction of their fourth-generation TPUs, for AI and ML workloads. TPUs, designed specifically to optimize AI computation, stood as Google's response to the rising dominance of GPUs. Google further documented the performance gains of the TPU v4 this year, offering a staggering 10x increase in ML system performance compared to its predecessor, TPU v3. With innovative interconnect technologies and domain-specific accelerators, the TPU v4 not only amplifies performance, but it also champions energy efficiency. Notably, the TPU v4 is tailored for LLMs such as LaMDA, MUM, and PaLM, with the PaLM model delivering 57.8% of peak hardware floating-point performance over 50 days of training on the TPU v4 (Jouppi & Patterson, 2022). The following month Google published a paper in Nature detailing their approach to using AI for the floor planning stage of chip design (Mirhoseini et al., 2021). This paper was the formalization of their 2020 blog post about AI powered chip design and made the findings more transparent. They also revealed that their fourth generation TPU, released just one month earlier, was designed using this new deep reinforcement learning technique (Vincent, 2021).\n","\n","### NERSC, HPE, Nvidia and AMD\n","Another major announcement came from Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the Perlmutter supercomputer, built by HPE in collaboration with Nvidia and AMD features around 6,159 Nvidia A100 GPUs and roughly 1,500 AMD Milan CPUs, collectively providing an impressive 3.8 exaflops of theoretical \"AI performance\". It has since been instrumental in mapping the visible universe spanning 11 billion light years by processing data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), with early benchmarking revealing up to 20X performance speedups using the GPUs, thus reducing computational timeframes from weeks or months to merely hours (HPC Wire, 2021).\n","\n","### Mythic\n","In June, Mythic announced the M1076 25 trillion operations per second (TOPS) AI processor which is capable of storing up to 80 million weighted parameters which means that it can run complex AI models without the need for external memory (Mitchell, 2021). The M1076 required ten times less power than a conventional system-on-chip or GPU. This introduction marked a shift towards creating more energy-efficient hardware solutions for AI, an important consideration as energy costs and environmental impacts become more of a concern (Sharma, 2021). \n","\n","### Cadence\n","Following the excitement of AI powered chip design in June, July brought the release of the Cerebrus platform from Cadence.

It wasn't until Hot Chips 33 in August that it got its true debut. The Grayskull is referred to as an \"all-in-one\" computer system. In preliminary experiments, the system hit 368 TOPs and had been observed processing up to 23,345 sentences per second using Google’s BERT-Base language model for the SQuAD 1.1 data set, giving it a 26 times performance advantage over existing solutions (Wiggers, 2020).\n","\n","### Apple\n","In October, Apple further upgraded the M1 series chips—released just a year prior and hailed as Apple's most powerful chips. The M1 Pro and M1 Max chips featured a standard but enhanced 16-core NPU for better on-device ML, showcasing Apple's focus on integrating ML in their products (\"Introducing M1 Pro and M1 Max,\" 2021). Although not a traditional AI pioneer, Apple is emphasizing Edge AI, deploying AI applications on physical devices rather than relying on centralized cloud servers.\n","\n","### AWS\n","Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued hardware announcements during their annual re:Invent conference in November 2021. Among these was the third generation of their Graviton hardware, Graviton3. This latest version is three times faster for ML workloads and up to a 60% energy saving compared to other leading hardware, giving it the \"best price-performance ratio in Amazon EC2\" (Nikita, 2022).\n","\n","### Groq\n","Although not technically released in 2021, the startup called Groq, founded by a former Google engineer in 2016, recieved a lot of attention in late 2021 when it announced that their flagship GroqChip or Groq tensor streaming processor was used for COVID drug discovery at Argonne National Laboratory and showed a 333x speed improvement compared to legacy GPUs at the time (Westfall, 2021).

The system includes the DGX A100, which is a single server system featuring multiple A100 GPUs. Since 2020, the A100 has served as the industry standard for GPU hardware which often prompts comparison when new hardware is released. Nvidia also announced the release of the H100 data center GPU, built with the new Hopper architecture with scalable speed for lower numerical accuracy. All of these components are specifically designed for deep learning training, accelerated analytics, and inference (Fu, 2022). Just one year after Google made their research and methods for incorporating AI into chip design, Nvidia announced their own incorporation of AI called 'PrefixRL'. Similar methods of reinforcement learning were incorporated into their new Hopper architecture resulting in circuits 25% smaller than those designed by humans with standard EDA tools (Roy, Raiman, & Godil, 2023). Around the same time, an internal struggle emerged at Google questioning the accuracy of findings in their original paper published in 2021 (Dave, 2022). In late 2022 Nvidia announced the new GeoForce 40 series GPU, Nvidia's more consumer centric hardware of choice.\n","\n","### Intel\n","Intel’s Habana Labs released the second generation of their deep learning processors for training and inference — Habana Gaudi2. Initial results show quicker trianing times for BERT in MLPerf benchmarks (Gupta, 2022).\n","\n","### Apple\n","In March and June, Apple also made significant strides in their hardware capabilities, unveiling the M1 Ultra and M2 chip, both next-generation enhancements of their breakthrough M1 chip. The M1 Ultra doubled the number of previous of neural engine cores from 16 to 32 (\"Apple unveils M1 Ultra,\" 2022). The new mac standard neural engine in M2 is around 40% faster than the prior year (\"Apple unveils M2,\" 2022). These advancements showed Apples continued innovation surrounding on-device machine learning.\n","\n","### IBM & Tokyo Electron\n","In July, IBM and Tokyo Electron made strides in 3D chip stacking by addressing the limitations posed by Moore's law. Silicon carrier wafers, a significant obstacle in 3D chip manufacturing, were at the core of their challenges. The advancements they've introduced are designed to optimize the production process, with the added advantage of potentially alleviating the global chip shortage (Peckham, 2022).\n","\n","### Cadence\n","In June, Cadence announced that customer adoption of the Cerebrus platform is growing and shared that a company called MediaTek has integraded Cerebrus into production. MediaTek powers more than two billion connected devices around the world [source]. Cadence also launched JedAI, a platform that integrates all the different AI chip design products [source].\n","\n","### Untether\n","In August, Untether AI introduced a device codenamed 'Boqueria', also known as SpeedAI240. This device is designed to enhance energy efficiency and density, allowing scalability for devices of different sizes, a feature that proves useful when working with language models of varying parameter sizes (Burt, 2022).\n","\n","### Cerebras\n","Meanwhile, Cerebras Systems launched their AI supercomputer, Andromeda, aiming to accelerate academic and commercial research. Both these major advancements were reported by Gupta (2022).\n","\n","### Tesla\n","On AI Day in September, Tesla revealed its powerful Dojo chip, designed for faster training and inference in self-driving cars. The chip is apparently so powerful that it \"tripped the power grid in Palo Alto\"[source]. Tesla claims that one Dojo chip can replace 6 GPUs. The Dojo is expected to increase Tesla’s ability to train neural nets using video data, which is in high demand in the self-driving car initiative at Tesla [source].\n","\n","### SambaNova\n","Additionally, SambaNova Systems announced the shipping of the second generation of the DataScale system—SN30. The system, powered by the Cardinal SN30 chip, is built for large models with more than 100 billion (100B) parameters and capable of handling both 2D and 3D images (Fu, 2022).\n","\n","### AWS\n","In October, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances, which are powered by AWS Trainium chips, build specifically for training high-performance ML applications in the cloud. Trn1 instances claim up to a 50% cost savings over comparable GPU-based EC2 instances for training large language models (Amazon Web Services, 2022). A month later, at AWS re:Invent 2022, Amazon made the EC2 Inf2 powered by the AWS Inferentia2 generally available. This machine learning accelerator, optimized for inference, offers larger compute density enabling lower cost per query. Inf2 also boasts the ability to deploy a 175B parameter model, such as GPT-3, in a single server. These two chip architectures represent a shift from using general purpose hardware to using hardware custom built to the specific phase of the system in order to lower task-specific compute costs (Liu, 2022).\n","\n","### IBM\n","November marks the launch of IBM's AIU chip. This unique chip confines GPU floating point operations to 8-bit, less precise than even a CPU with higher compute density and similar model accuracy. Furthermore, it demands less power and memory compared to other top-tier GPUs with identical measures. The primary advantage lies in its affordability. Priced around \\$1,000 per chip, a set of ten AIUs could rival the performance of the Nvidia H100 GPU, which ranges between \\$20,000 to \\$30,000. IBM believes this platform will make model training 1000 times faster by 2030 (Morgan, 2022).\n","\n","### OpenAI\n","OpenAI's November 2022 release of ChatGPT underscored the key role of hardware in AI performance. Training the GPT-3 on 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs facilitated managing the 175B parameters and 45-terabyte dataset in a reasonable timeframe. Moreover, real-time inference demands powerful servers for model hosting and efficient hardware for quick request processing. It's estimated OpenAI uses around 3,617 HGX A100 servers, or 28,936 single A100 GPUs, daily to serve ChatGPT. Despite high upfront costs, this large-scale infrastructure enables a low per query cost of 0.36 cents (Patel & Ahmad, 2023). Thus, ChatGPT exemplifies a successful AI system, leveraging specialized hardware at each production stage."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;flex-direction:column;\">\n","    <h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Table 2.

Google I/O, Microsoft Build, and Apple WWDC each highlighted primarily software advancments that indicate the companies priorites. Microsoft is fully embracing and participating in the AI race with new virtual assistants, product features, Azure Supercomputer, and open LLMs just to name a few. Many were suprised at the lack of a TPUv5 announcement at Google I/O given that it has been acknowledged to exist back in 2021 (). The emphasis across the board seems to be around enhancing existing products with AI without any major hardware leaps disclosed.\n","\n","### LLMs\n","The late 2022 release of OpenAI's ChatGPT has sparked a surge in AI advancements over the following six months, primarily fueled by an increased demand for advanced GPU hardware. The competitive landscape, featuring key players like Google with their Bard powered by PaLM 2, Microsoft's Bing AI, and Meta's LLaMA, has been driven by the development of large language models (LLMs). Latest AI hardware's power and efficiency is crucial for training large language models (LLMs), broadening their practical uses. However, hardware is just one facet of product development. Choices about parameter and data size critically shape the design, affecting everything from hardware requirements to training duration and model performance. For instance, the implications of choosing 175B parameters for OpenAI's GPT-3, 1.8 trillion for GPT-4, versus LLaMA's 65B parameters are considerable.\n","\n","### Apple\n","Apple, a bit more withdrawn from the hype surrounding AI, did not once mention the term \"artificial intelligence\" at WWDC (Greenburg, 2023). Instead they unveiled numerous software improvements for ML across the device ecosystem along with the upgraded M2 Ultra's 32-core neural engine touted as 40% faster than the prior year 32-core model with 31.6 TOPs. (\"Apple introduces M2 Ultra,\" 2023).\n","\n","### Nvidia\n","Nvidia's Grace CPU Superchips, now integrated into the UK-based Isambard 3 supercomputer, provides superior speed and memory bandwidth with its 55,000+ core count. These benefits stem from its incorporation of Arm Neoverse V2 cores (Kennedy, 2023). Nvidia's DGX GH200 supercomputer is powered by a combination of the new Grace Hopper 200 GPU and the Grace CPU, with features like 528 GPU tensor cores, 4 TB/s memory bandwidth, and 144 TB of shared memory, marking an almost 500-fold increase compared to the previous generation DGX A100. A cluster of 256 such configurations offers a staggering 1 ExaFLOP (Edwards, 2023).\n","\n","### Intel\n","Intel, with its Meteor Lake chips, embedded Vision Processing Units (VPUs) across all variants, thereby offloading AI processing tasks from the CPU and GPU to the VPU. This move resulted in increased power efficiency and ability to handle complex AI models, providing benefits for power-hungry applications such as Adobe suite, Microsoft Teams, and Unreal Engine (Roach, 2023). Intel also introduced the 4th generation Xeon processors with 10x speed improvement for Pytorch training/inference. The update Xeon series offers optimized models for high-performance, low-latency networks and edge workloads (Smith, 2023).\n","\n","### AMD\n","AMD introduced an AI chip called MI300X, described as \"the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI\". This introduction is expected to compete head-on with Nvidia's AI chips and generate interest from major cloud providers. Simultaneously, AMD initiated high-volume shipping of a general-purpose central processor chip named \"Bergamo\", adopted by Meta Platforms and others for their computing infrastructure (Mohan, 2023).\n","\n","### Meta\n","Meta made its foray into AI hardware by unveiling its first custom-designed chips, the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) and the Meta Scalable Video Processor (MSVP). These chips, optimized for deep learning and video processing, underpin Meta's plans for a next-gen data center optimized for AI, illustrating its dedication to crafting a fully integrated AI ecosystem (Khare, 2023).\n","\n","### Groq\n","Groq gained recent attention by claiming that it had created a process to move Meta's LLaMA from Nvidia chips over to its own hardware signaling a potential threat to Nvidia's 90% GPU market share. The complexity of the current AI hardware makes it a tedious task to adapt model architectures to run quickly on new setups (Lee & Nellis, 2023). \n","\n","### AI Assisted Chip Design\n","AI assisted chip design has resurfaced as a more popular avenue for manufacturers. Although there haven't been any significant announcements made this year with regard to AI designed chips, there is a shifting sentiment that this movement is going more mainstream due to the increase in customer contracts being reported by Synopsys and Cadence. (Ward-Foxton, 2023).\n","\n","### TBD\n","While these advancements in 2023 are indeed significant, it's important to note that the main AI Hardware conferences such as AI Hardware Summit, AWS Re:Invent, Hot Chips, and other popular conferences are yet to occur.

MLPerf is a set of industry-standard metrics that evaluates the speed of ML software and hardware. It specifically assesses training and inference performance, scalability, and power performance, tailoring these assessments to the requirements of each specific model or task (Bunting, 2023).\n","\n","Although MLPerf launched in 2018, it wasn't until the very end of 2020 that it was properly scaled and standardized into the ML Commons consortium. The development of these benchmarks came together for their first official debut as MLPerf v1.0 in 2021. MLPerf consists of eight benchmark tests: image recognition, medical-imaging segmentation, two versions of object detection, speech recognition, natural-language processing, recommendation, and reinforcement learning. Often referred to as \"the Olympics of machine learning\", MLPerf features computer hardware and software from 21 different companies competing on any or all the tests (Moore, 2022). This incentivizes hardware companies like Nvidia to put their best foot forward. The results of the June 2022 MLPerf v2.0 benchmark tests were compared to Moore's law to show the unexpected rate of progress achieved in training times alone. The 2022 MLPerf results showed 9-10x increase in training time performance vs 2018 as shown in Figure 4 (Moore, 2022)."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: #333; padding: 20px;\">\n","      <img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-shows-six-lines-of-various-colors-sweeping-up-and-to-the-right.jpg?id=30049159&width=1580&quality=80\" width=\"450\">\n","</div>"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div align=\"center\">\n","\n","**Figure 4.** MLPerf Training Time Benchmarks vs Moore's Law.

It achieved the fastest time to train on four out of eight tests and was found to be the fastest on a per-chip basis on six out of the eight tests. This performance was attributed to full-stack innovations spanning GPUs, software, and at-scale improvements, delivering 23x more performance in 3.5 years since the first MLPerf submission (Salvator, 2022).

Task-specific benchmarks, such as MLPerf, will play an increasingly influential role in measuring this progress across the growing lineup of products. Recent developments in AI hardware demonstrate an emphasis on specialization, such as dedicating specific chip architectures to model training and inference tasks to lower the computational costs.
