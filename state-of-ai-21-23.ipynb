Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games described this transition in a recent tweet. He states, \"Artificial intelligence is doubling at a rate much faster than Moore’s Law’s 2 years, or evolutionary biology’s 2M years. Why? Because we’re bootstrapping it on the back of both laws. And if it can feed back into its own acceleration, that’s a stacked exponential.\" (Sweeney, 2023). \n","\n","Traditionally, Moore's Law, which predicts a 2-year doubling of transistors integrated onto a circuit, has served as the benchmark for anticipated growth in computing power. Yet, in the past two years, acceleration hardware has surpassed this prediction in several ways (Moore, 2022). What advancements in AI related acceleration hardware have been made in the last two years? What are the factors driving the pace of hardware innovation? How can we measure the performance achieved? What does the acceleration in performance mean for the future of AI? While it is impossible to cover every development, this essay will explore these questions in order to encapsulate the current state of AI acceleration hardware in 2023."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Historical Context"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The term \"artificial intelligence\" was first used by scientists John McCarthy, Claude Shannon, and Marvin Minsky at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. With optimistic expectations for the field's potential, Minsky boldly proclaimed in 1970 that machines with average human intelligence would exist in the near future. The hype surrounding this forecast ignited an investment wave that lasted over a decade and culminated in an AI bubble. However, when this bubble burst in the early 1980s, AI development regressed back to research labs, and the field entered what is now referred to as the \"AI Winter\". (Jotrin Electronics, 2022).\n","\n","In the early years of computer hardware development, Central Processing Units (CPUs) were the primary source of innovation around computing capabilities. Moore's Law had been the guiding principle for the advancement of these CPUs, predicting a steady pace of growth. However, the demands of AI computations quickly exceeded the capabilities of these CPU architectures, resulting in much slower progress than originally anticipated by Minsky. \n","\n","The advent of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) by Nvidia in 1999 marked a significant change in the computing landscape. Initially used for 3D graphics in video games, their potential in AI model training wasn't recognized until a decade later. The use of GPUs for model training marked an acceleration in AI hardware, far surpassing the advancements predicted by Moore's Law.\n","\n","This acceleration reached a tipping point in 2012 with the advent of AlexNet, a groundbreaking neural network model powered by Nvidia's GPU hardware. AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by delivering a record-setting image recognition accuracy (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018).\n","\n","The use of hardware in AI has since become a key factor in the speed and efficiency of model training and deployment. In response to the limitations of GPUs, AI-assisted chip design emerged around 2018, leading to innovations like Google's framework for optimizing chip design through a game framework (Goldie & Mirhoseini, 2020) and Synopsys' DSO.ai, the \"world's first autonomous AI application for chip design\" (Synopsys, 2023).\n","\n","The ongoing global chip shortage, which began with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, further underscores the need for innovations in semiconductor production. This shortage and the accompanying surge in demand for consumer electronics have elevated the priority of smarter semiconductor manufacturing, setting the stage for significant advancements in AI hardware between 2021 and 2023 (Appenzeller, Bornstein, & Casado, 2023)."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Measuring AI Hardware Progress"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Before delving into recent hardware advances, it is crucial to establish an understanding of certain key measurement terminologies for comparing performance. Traditional central processing unit (CPU) power is typically evaluated based on either transistor count or clock speed represented in terahertz (THz). More relvant to the material here are accelerators such as a graphics processing unit (GPU), neural processing unit (NPU), or tensor processing unit (TPU), gauge their overall computational capability, known as \"bulk compute,\" primarily in variations of floating point operations per second (FLOPS). This measurement describes the number of calculations a chip can execute within a second. Among other variants, we have TeraFLOPS (TFLOPS), which stands for trillions of FLOPS, and tera operations per second (TOPS), a similar measure that incorporates both integer and floating point calculations typically in 64-bit numbers for accuracy. PetaOp/s, denoting a quadrillion operations per second, is yet another variant. Other important indicators of hardware performance include energy efficiency and the amount of memory the chip can move in and out at one time commonly measured in megabytes (MB) or terabytes (TB) per second. These measures serve as key indicators of hardware performance in the realm of artificial intelligence.\n","\n","\n","Focusing solely on CPU power or transistor count to compare hardware fails to capture the true extent of recent progress in AI compute.

Yet, with the onset of recent tech innovations, this relationship has shown signs of strain. As we moved into the 2020s, the technology community began questioning the continued relevance of Moore's Law. Influential pieces, like \"We're not prepared for the end of Moore's Law\" (Hoffman, 2020), published in the MIT Technology Review, cast doubts over the longevity of this once-dependable guideline in relation to its prediction of transistor count. On the other hand, some argued that Moore's Law was not dead, but its definition needed broadening. It was clear that we needed more comprehensive metrics to gauge computing advancements and accurately predict future trajectories.\n","\n","The charts below illustrate how the growth in computational demand for different AI models has veered ahead of Moore's Law since 2012. The compute utilized in AI training has swelled by over 300,000 times, with a doubling time of merely 3.4 months. If progress had adhered strictly to Moore's Law, the increase would have been limited to a factor of seven (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018).

It merges two of the most computationally intensive fields in AI: computer vision and natural language processing. To train models like DALL-E and its underlying model, GPT-3, and deep learning models for images, substantial hardware resources are necessary. Moreover, to operate at scale, the model depends on a potent combination of efficient processing power, robust networking capabilities, and high-speed storage hardware. While the exact hardware setup of DALL-E haven't been disclosed, recent attempts to replicate DALL-E on a much smaller scale have shown the complexity of end-to-end hardware setup (Cuenca, 2023).\n","\n","In early 2021, Graphcore, a U.K. based chip manufacturer announced its second generation of the Colossus intelligence processing unit (IPU), GC200 Colossus MK2. Each GC200 IPU has 59 billion transistors, 1,472 independent programmable cores, and 250 TFLOPS. This level of parallel processing capability was designed to effectively handle the sparsity and irregularity of machine learning workloads, providing a different approach to the more common Nvidia's GPUs (Doherty, 2021).\n","\n","In April, Cerebras Systems, a renowned AI chip startup, relased the WSE-2 the largest chip ever built. This chip boasted 850,000 cores and 2.6 trillion transistors. This capacity more than doubles that of its predecessor, the WSE-1 (Dilmengani, 2023). Cerebras also announced the \"world's first brain-scale\" AI solution. This term stems from the estimate that the human brain has an order of 100 trillion synapses and prior to this existing AI clusters could match about 1% of this. The CS-2 accelerator, the size of a smaller refrigerator, to support models of over 120 trillion parameters in size (Business Wire, 2021).\n","\n","The Nvidia Grace CPU was also announced in April, the company's first data center CPU, was designed to address the computational requirements of advanced applications such as natural language processing, recommender systems, and AI supercomputing that analyze large datasets. Grace combined energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with a unique low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with remarkable efficiency. This Arm-based processor aimed to provide a ten-fold performance increase for systems training large AI models, compared to leading servers at the time. Notably, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory have plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers to support scientific research efforts (Nvidia, 2021).\n","\n","In May, Google announced the introduction of their fourth-generation TPUs, for AI and ML workloads. TPUs, designed specifically to optimize AI computation, stood as Google's response to the rising dominance of GPUs. Google further documented the performance gains of the TPU v4 this year, offering a staggering 10x increase in ML system performance compared to its predecessor, TPU v3. With innovative interconnect technologies and domain-specific accelerators, the TPU v4 not only amplifies performance, but it also champions energy efficiency. Notably, the TPU v4 is tailored for LLMs such as LaMDA, MUM, and PaLM, with the PaLM model delivering 57.8% of peak hardware floating-point performance over 50 days of training on the TPU v4 (Jouppi & Patterson, 2022).\n","\n","Another major announcement came from Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the Perlmutter supercomputer, built by HPE in collaboration with Nvidia and AMD features around 6,159 Nvidia A100 GPUs and roughly 1,500 AMD Milan CPUs, collectively providing an impressive 3.8 exaflops of theoretical \"AI performance\". It has since been instrumental in mapping the visible universe spanning 11 billion light years by processing data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), with early benchmarking revealing up to 20X performance speedups using the GPUs, thus reducing computational timeframes from weeks or months to merely hours (HPC Wire, 2021).\n","\n","In June, Mythic announced the M1076 25 trillion operations per second (TOPS) AI processor which is capable of storing up to 80 million weighted parameters which means that it can run complex AI models without the need for external memory (Mitchell, 2021). The M1076 required ten times less power than a conventional system-on-chip or GPU.

Nvidia announced the release of their new DGX Station, DGX-1, and DGX-2 built on state-of-the-art Volta GPU architecture (Gupta, 2022). The system includes the DGX A100, which is a single server system featuring multiple A100 GPUs. The chip has integrated eight GPUs at 312 TFLOPs a piece and has a GPU memory of 640 GB. Nvidia also announced the release of the H100 data center GPU, built with the new Hopper architecture boasting 60 TFLOPS with 64-bit, and scalable speed for lower numerical accuracy. All of these components are specifically designed for deep learning training, accelerated analytics, and inference (Fu, 2022).\n","\n","Just one year after Google made their research and methods for incorporating AI into chip design, Nvidia announced their own incorporation of AI called 'PrefixRL'. Similar methods of reinforcement learning were incorporated into their new Hopper architecture resulting in circuits 25% smaller than those designed by humans with standard EDA tools (Roy, Raiman, & Godil, 2023). Around the same time, an internal struggle emerged at Google questioning the accuracy of findings in their original paper published in 2021 (Dave, 2022). \n","\n","Intel’s Habana Labs released the second generation of their deep learning processors for training and inference — Habana Gaudi2 (Gupta, 2022). IBM launched their first Telum Processor-based system, IBM z16, aimed at improving performance and efficiency for large datasets and featuring on-chip acceleration for AI inference (Fu, 2022).\n","\n","In March and June, Apple also made significant strides in their hardware capabilities, unveiling the M1 Ultra and M2 chip, both next-generation enhancements of their breakthrough M1 chip. The M1 Ultra doubled the number of previous of neural engine cores from 16 to 32 (\"Apple unveils M1 Ultra,\" 2022). The new mac standard neural engine in M2 can process up to 15.8 TOPS, 40% faster than the prior year. (\"Apple unveils M2,\" 2022).\n","\n","In July, IBM and Tokyo Electron made strides in 3D chip stacking by addressing the limitations posed by Moore's law. Silicon carrier wafers, a significant obstacle in 3D chip manufacturing, were at the core of their challenges. The advancements they've introduced are designed to optimize the production process, with the added advantage of potentially alleviating the global chip shortage (Peckham, 2022).\n","\n","In August, Untether AI introduced a device codenamed 'Boqueria', also known as speedAI240. This 2 PFLOPs device is designed to enhance energy efficiency and density, allowing scalability for devices of different sizes — a feature that proves useful when working with language models of varying parameter sizes (Burt, 2022).\n","\n","On AI Day in September, Tesla revealed its powerful Dojo chip, designed for faster training and inference in self-driving cars. Meanwhile, Cerebras Systems launched their AI supercomputer, Andromeda, aiming to accelerate academic and commercial research. Both these major advancements were reported by Gupta (2022).\n","\n","AMD, though not traditionally focused on AI, released Zen 4, a new version of their Zen microarchitecture built on a 5 nm architecture, and introduced a new line of PC processors for ML capabilities. Additionally, SambaNova Systems announced the shipping of the second generation of the DataScale system—SN30. The system, powered by the Cardinal SN30 chip, is built for large models with more than 100 billion (100B) parameters and capable of handling both 2D and 3D images. These developments were detailed by Fu (2022).\n","\n","The 2022 AI Hardware Summit in September showcased the emergent trend of Edge AI, pointing out its potential as a major avenue for growth and performance improvement. Edge AI has seen remarkable advancement due to the maturation of deep learning and enhanced computing power. Edge AI has enormous advantages such as reduced latency, better privacy, and reduced energy consumption. Furthermore, a noticeable shift was identified toward TPUs in Edge AI, with more vendors beginning to adopt TPUs as AI accelerators. The Summit also highlighted how AI chips have now advanced to the level of detecting human emotions, emphasizing the impressive strides being made in object detection (Fu, 2022). \n","\n","In October, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances, which are powered by AWS Trainium chips, build specifically for training high-performance ML applications in the cloud. Trn1 instances claim up to a 50% cost savings over comparable GPU-based EC2 instances for training large language models (Amazon Web Services, 2022). A month later, at AWS re:Invent 2022, Amazon made the EC2 Inf2 powered by the AWS Inferentia2 generally available. This machine learning accelerator, optimized for inference, offers larger compute density enabling lower cost per query. Inf2 also boasts the ability to deploy a 175B parameter model, such as GPT-3, in a single server. These two chip architectures represent a shift from using general purpose hardware to using hardware custom built to the specific phase of the system in order to lower task-specific compute costs (Liu, 2022).\n","\n","November marks the launch of IBM's AIU chip. This unique chip confines GPU floating point operations to 8-bit, a move that permits a vast increase in calculations per second with similar training accuracy. Furthermore, it demands less power and memory compared to other top-tier GPUs with identical measures. The chip shines with approximately 205 TFLOPs for 8-bit operations and 820 TFLOPs for 4-bit. The primary advantage lies in its affordability. Priced around $1,000 per chip, a set of ten AIUs could rival the performance of the Nvidia H100 GPU, which ranges between $20,000 to $30,000. IBM believes this platform will make model training 1000 times faster by 2030 (Morgan, 2022).\n","\n","The November 2022 release of ChatGPT by OpenAI has highlighted the essential role of hardware in driving AI performance. The high-level functionality of ChatGPT demands significant memory, storage, and interconnect technology. For instance, GPT-3 was trained on an extensive network of 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Each Nvidia A100, which is a roughly $12,000 tensor core GPU (Kandel, 2023), is necessary to allow the 175B parameters to be trained on the 45 terabyte dataset in a reasonable amount of time. Once the model is trained, the real-time inference stage requires powerful servers for hosting the model, as well as efficient hardware capable of quickly processing requests to produce predictions quickly. A recent article suggested that OpenAI requires around 3,617 HGX A100 servers, equivalent to 28,936 single A100 GPUs, to serve ChatGPT every day. While the overhead of acquiring this hardware is very large, the massive infastructure allows ChatGPT to operate at a low cost per query of 0.36 cents (Patel & Ahmad, 2023). ChatGPT is a successful AI system that relies on highly specialized hardware for each component of model production."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;flex-direction:column;\">\n","    <h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Hardware Summary 2022</h3>\n","    <table style=\"border:1px solid black;

The competitive landscape, featuring key players like Google with their Bard powered by PaLM 2, Microsoft's Bing AI, and Meta's LLaMA, has been driven by the development of large language models (LLMs). Latest AI hardware's power and efficiency is crucial for training large language models (LLMs), broadening their practical uses. However, hardware is just one facet of product development. Choices about parameter and data size critically shape the design, affecting everything from hardware requirements to training duration and model performance. For instance, the implications of choosing 175B parameters for OpenAI's GPT-3, 1.8 trillion for GPT-4, versus LLaMA's 65B parameters are considerable.\n","\n","The 2023 developer conferences from Google, Apple, and Microsoft gave us a preview of the types of advancements we are going to see in the second half of the year and beyond. Google I/O, Microsoft Build, and Apple WWDC each highlighted advancements in AI hardware and software. Google and Microsoft are fully embracing and participating in the AI race with new virtual assistants, product features, and open LLMs just to name a few. Apple, a bit more withdrawn from the hype surrounding AI, did not once mention the term \"artificial intelligence\" at WWDC (Greenburg, 2023). Instead they unveiled numerous software improvements for ML across the device ecosystem along with the upgraded M2 Ultra's 32-core neural engine touted as 40% faster than the prior year 32-core model with 31.6 TOPs. (\"Apple introduces M2 Ultra,\" 2023).\n","\n","Nvidia marked a substantial milestone with its Grace CPU Superchips, finding a place in the UK-based Isambard 3 supercomputer. This setup, featuring 384 Arm-based Nvidia Grace CPU Superchips, commands a total core count exceeding 55,000. The incorporation of Arm Neoverse V2 cores offers a high-performance edge, as the Grace chips are projected to have superior speed and memory bandwidth compared to their counterparts (Kennedy, 2023).\n","\n","Intel, with its Meteor Lake chips, embedded Vision Processing Units (VPUs) across all variants, thereby offloading AI processing tasks from the CPU and GPU to the VPU. This move resulted in increased power efficiency and ability to handle complex AI models, providing benefits for power-hungry applications such as Adobe suite, Microsoft Teams, and Unreal Engine (Roach, 2023). Intel also introduced the 4th generation Xeon processors with 10x speed improvement for Pytorch training/inference. The update Xeon series offers optimized models for high-performance, low-latency networks and edge workloads (Smith, 2023).\n","\n","AMD introduced an AI chip called MI300X, described as \"the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI\". This introduction is expected to compete head-on with Nvidia's AI chips and generate interest from major cloud providers. Simultaneously, AMD initiated high-volume shipping of a general-purpose central processor chip named \"Bergamo\", adopted by Meta Platforms and others for their computing infrastructure (Mohan, 2023).\n","\n","Meta made its foray into AI hardware by unveiling its first custom-designed chips, the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) and the Meta Scalable Video Processor (MSVP). These chips, optimized for deep learning and video processing, underpin Meta's plans for a next-gen data center optimized for AI, illustrating its dedication to crafting a fully integrated AI ecosystem (Khare, 2023).\n","\n","Groq gained recent attention by claiming that it had created a process to move Meta's LLaMA from Nvidia chips over to its own hardware signaling a potential threat to Nvidia's 90% GPU market share. The complexity of the current AI hardware makes it a tedious task to adapt model architectures to run quickly on new setups (Lee & Nellis, 2023). \n","\n","AI assisted chip design has resurfaced as a more popular avenue for manufacturers. Although there haven't been any significant announcements made this year with regard to AI designed chips, there is a shifting sentiment that this movement is going more mainstream due to the increase in customer contracts being reported by Synopsys and Cadence. (Ward-Foxton, 2023).\n","\n","While these advancements in 2023 are indeed significant, it's important to note that the main AI Hardware conferences such as AI Hardware Summit, AWS Re:Invent, Hot Chips, and other popular conferences are yet to occur.

MLPerf consists of eight benchmark tests: image recognition, medical-imaging segmentation, two versions of object detection, speech recognition, natural-language processing, recommendation, and a form of gameplay called reinforcement learning. Often referred to as \"the Olympics of machine learning\", MLPerf features computer hardware and software from 21 different companies competing on any or all the tests (Moore, 2022). This incentivizes hardware companies like Nvidia to put their best foot forward. The results of the June 2022 MLPerf v2.0 benchmark tests were compared to Moore's law to show the unexpected rate of progress achieved in training times alone.

On the other hand, optimists such as Andrew Ng see the potential of superior AI to drive unprecedented advancements and solve global challenges (Cherney, 2023). Just as these modern figures grapple with uncertainty regarding AI development, the pioneers of this field also reflected deeply on the implications of machine advancement.\n","\n","Reflecting on the pace of technological progress, Samuel Butler (1863) expressed this observation in his essay, \"There is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now... Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing.\" Butler's words highlight the staggering speed of machine evolution, especially when compared to the slow, incremental changes seen in biological organisms.\n","\n","Years later, Alan Turing echoed these sentiments. Turing (1951) reflected on the unpredictable nature of the technological advancements of his time, asserting, \"We can see plenty there that needs to be done, and although we can make some fairly reliable, though quite rough, guesses, based on past experience, as to the order in which these developments will come, there remains the possibility that any one particular piece of research may lead to consequences of a revolutionary character.\""]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Whether or not machines will surpass human intelligence is an age old question.

The successor released in March 2023, GPT-4, contains 1.8 trillion parameters and was trained on 1 petabyte of data (E2Analyst, 2023). Any improvements in training cost for GPT-3 are now irrelevant due to the higher cost of data and much larger parameter size. A recent report by OpenAI analyzed training cost of recent AI models and found that the cost of training is increasing exponentially as shown below. Their data shows that the cost of training a model is expected to rise to $500 million USD by 2030. The primary factor driving this increase in expense is the need for more data. As model architectures become more complex the more data they will need to train on as evidenced by the recent GPT-4 (Cottier, 2023)."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div align=\"center\">\n","    <div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 40%;\">\n","        <img src=\"https://mpost.io/wp-content/uploads/image-82-40.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">\n","    </div>\n","</div>"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["While we continue to see hardware shortages and specialized GPUs remaining costly (Vanian, 2023), a recent estimate shows that the cost of AI hardware and software, when measured by relative compute unit (RCU), will continue to decline at a consistent rate.

Addressing current computational demands extends beyond simply creating more powerful hardware or doubling the number of transistors on a chip. Lower costs and greater access are achieved by optimizing hardware, software, and algorithms for the full range of system requirements. Task-specific benchmarks, such as MLPerf, will play an increasingly influential role in measuring this progress across the growing lineup of products. Recent developments in AI hardware demonstrate an emphasis on specialization, such as dedicating specific chip architectures to model training and inference tasks to lower the computational costs. However, there exists a tension between cost-efficiency and the democratization of AI systems. While hardware costs are decreasing, the growing demand for data threatens to offset these gains.
