    "Since early 2021, there has been an unprecedented transformation in artificial intelligence (AI) system hardware capabilities, surpassing traditional benchmarks such as Moore's Law, which predicts a two-year doubling rate of transistors on a circuit. Processing capability has historically been limited by the number of transistors; however, recent years have witnessed an accelerated doubling rate of processing power, particularly in hardware designed for AI applications. The current doubling rates are outpacing not only technological growth as predicted by Moore's Law, but also biological evolution, which has taken millions of years. This has occurred despite an overall deceleration in the doubling rate of transistors. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney recently noted this phenomenon, \"Artificial intelligence is doubling at a rate much faster than Moore’s Law’s 2 years, or evolutionary biology’s 2M years. Why? Because we’re bootstrapping it on the back of both laws. And if it can feed back into its own acceleration, that’s a stacked exponential\" (Sweeney, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the question: How has such rapid innovation in AI systems been enabled despite a slowdown in traditional hardware performance standards? The rapid acceleration of AI related hardware capabilities has profound implications for the practitioners within the machine learning (ML) community and the long-term outlook for our ability to provide value. This essay will explore the key breakthroughs, driving forces, and alternate performance measures of processing hardware developed during the period of 2021 to mid-2023. The discussion will focus on how processing and acceleration advancements impact various data types, improve the efficiency of AI applications, and make complex AI systems more accessible. While it is impossible to detail every development, this essay strives to provide a comprehensive picture of how working and experimenting with AI hardware within this recent timeframe has changed the ML community."

    "Coined in 1956 by scientists including John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, \"artificial intelligence\" ignited an investment wave that led to an \"AI bubble\" during the 1970s. However, the computational demands of early AI quickly outpaced CPU capabilities. CPUs are capable of performing a variety of complex tasks, but they do so sequentially. This meant that they were not well-suited to the vector and matrix operations that AI algorithms require. When the \"AI Bubble\" burst in the early 1980s, AI development regressed into what is now referred to as the \"AI winter\" (Jotrin Electronics, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1999, Nvidia introduced the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a new type of processor that enabled many operations to be performed simultaneously. This speedup in computation capability earned GPUs the name \"accelerators.\" GPUs are much better suited to manage the vector and matrix operations that AI algorithms require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true potential of GPUs for AI was first recognized in 2012 when a neural network model known as AlexNet, trained using Nvidia's GPUs, won the ImageNet competition. This achievement sparked widespread acceptance of GPUs for AI (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018). Since then, specialized hardware accelerators meant for large amounts of mathematical computations such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Neural Processing Units (NPUs), and Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) have become essential tools for AI model training and deployment. Further innovations in the field, including AI-assisted chip design, started gaining popularity around 2018. These led to the development of frameworks like Google's chip design optimization platform (Goldie & Mirhoseini, 2020) and Synopsys' DSO.ai, an AI application for autonomous chip design (Synopsys, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ongoing global chip shortage, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted the need for semiconductor production innovations. The shortage has been exacerbated by sharp increases in consumer electronics demand during the pandemic and the ever-growing demand for GPUs to train more complex AI models. Despite these setbacks, there have been significant AI hardware advancements between 2021 and 2023."

    "Before examining hardware advancements, it is essential to establish common performance measurement terminology. CPU power is typically assessed by transistor count, size of transistors in nanometers (nm), or clock speed in terahertz (THz). Accelerators like GPUs measure computational capacity, often termed \"bulk compute,\" in floating point operations per second (FLOPS) or integer-based operations per second (OPS). These units gauge the calculations a chip can perform in one second, with variants like TeraFLOPS/TeraOPS (trillion FLOPS/OPS), PetaFLOPS/PetaOPS (quadrillion FLOPS/OPS), and ExaFLOPS/ExaOPS (quintillion FLOPS/OPS). Also, total energy used (watts), energy efficiency (FLOPS/OPS per watt) and data transfer capability, measured in megabytes (MB), terabytes (TB), or petabytes (PB) per second, are important accelerator performance indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only CPU power or transistor count to compare hardware overlooks recent AI compute progress. For instance, Apple's NPU or \"neural engine\" has seen over 100% annual improvements in bulk compute, surpassing both CPU and GPU growth. Figure 1a shows the historical processing power of Apple's A-series iPhone System on a Chip (SoC) as well as the isolated CPU, GPU, NPU. The composition of the A14 SoC is shown in Figure 1b. The growth in bulk compute in the SoC, shown by the dotted line, is on an annual improvement pace of 118% since 2015 (Vellante & Floyer, 2021)."

    "OpenAI identified three components reflecting AI progress in a 2018 study: algorithmic innovation, data, and training compute, with OPS as a crucial measure surpassing clock speed's relevance (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018). Moore's Law, correlating with the transistor count growth trend and ML advancement, shows signs of strain due to tech innovations. As the 2020s began, the tech community questioned Moore's Law's relevance, with MIT Technology Review's \"We're Not Prepared for the End of Moore's Law\" (Hoffman, 2020) casting doubts. However, some suggested a broader Moore's Law definition and more comprehensive metrics for computing advancements. Figure 2 shows the distinction of growth prior to and after 2012."

    "Investment in AI hardware development significantly increased in 2021, with the total capital invested globally almost doubling to \\$68 billion (Sharma, 2021). Precedence Research valued the 2021 AI hardware market at \\$10 billion, projecting growth to \\$90 billion by 2030 as shown in Figure 6 (Precedence Research, 2022). In 2021, the market demand for AI hardware was primarily driven by the need for more powerful processors, as depicted in Figure 7. This demand arose due to the significant divergence seen in the trajectories of compute power, which is vividly illustrated in Figure 8. Despite the limitations of storage and network compute power on the overall system's capabilities, it was the processors that boosted system compute measured in OPS. Specialized processors and accelerators increasingly bypassed the need for network or storage hardware by optimizing data flow on-device. This reduced the reliance on transferring data over the network, resulting in more efficient and faster computation (Vellante & Floyer, 2021)."

    "### OpenAI\n",
    "OpenAI launched DALL-E in January, a multimodal AI system generating images from text. Although not a hardware product by itself, its computational implications are vast, combining computer vision and natural language processing—two resource-intensive AI fields. Training and scaling the underlying models of DALL-E require considerable hardware resources to train OpenAI's own third generation generative pretrained transformer model (GPT-3). Maintaining a production model like this requires enormous processing power, networking capabilities, and high-speed storage. While DALL-E's exact hardware setup remains undisclosed, replicating it on smaller scales reveals the complexity of hardware setup (Cuenca, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphcore\n",
    "In early 2021, Graphcore, a U.K.-based chip manufacturer announced its second generation of the Colossus intelligence processing unit (IPU), GC200 Colossus MK2. The GC200 is designed for a higher level of parallel processing capability to effectively manage the sparsity and irregularity of ML workloads, providing a different approach to the more common Nvidia's GPUs (Doherty, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cerebras Systems\n",
    "In April, Cerebras Systems, a renowned AI chip startup, released the WSE-2 the largest chip ever built. The capacity more than doubles that of its predecessor, the WSE-1 (Dilmengani, 2023). Cerebras also announced the \"world's first brain-scale\" AI solution. This term stems from the estimate that the human brain has an order of 100 trillion synapses and prior to this, existing AI clusters could match about 1% of that size. The CS-2 accelerator that is the size of a small refrigerator, supports models of over 120 trillion parameters but is comprised of only one WSE-2 chip (Business Wire, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nvidia \n",
    "The Nvidia Grace CPU, announced in April, was the company's first data center CPU designed to address the computational requirements of advanced applications such as natural language processing, recommender systems, and AI supercomputing with large datasets. Grace combined energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with a unique low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with remarkable efficiency. This Arm-based processor aimed to provide a 10-fold performance increase for systems training large AI models, compared to leading servers at the time. Notably, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory have plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers to support scientific research efforts (Nvidia, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google\n",
    "In May, Google announced the introduction of their fourth-generation TPUs, for AI and ML workloads. TPUs, designed specifically to optimize AI computation, stood as Google's response to the rising dominance of GPUs. Google further documented the performance gains of the TPU v4 this year, offering a staggering 10 times increase in ML system performance compared to its predecessor, TPU v3. With innovative interconnect technologies and domain-specific accelerators, the TPU v4 not only amplifies performance, but it also champions energy efficiency. Notably, the TPU v4 is engineered for large language models (LLMs) such as Google's Pathways Language Model (PaLM), delivering 57.8% of peak hardware floating-point performance over 50 days of training on the TPU v4 (Jouppi & Patterson, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following month Google published a paper in the journal Nature detailing their approach to using AI for the floor planning stage of chip design (Mirhoseini et al., 2021). This paper was the formalization of their 2020 blog post about AI powered chip design and made the findings more transparent. They also revealed that their fourth generation TPU, released just one month earlier, was designed using this new deep reinforcement learning technique (Vincent, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### HPE, AMD, and Nvidia\n",
    "The month of May also featured an announcement from Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) in collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia completed the Perlmutter supercomputer. It has since been instrumental in mapping the visible universe spanning 11 billion light years by processing data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Early benchmarking has revealed up to 20 times performance speedups using the GPUs, reducing required compute time from weeks or months to merely hours (Trader, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mythic\n",
    "In June, Mythic announced the M1076 AI processor, which can store up to 80 million weighted parameters. This means that it can run complex AI models without the need for external memory (Mitchell, 2021). The M1076 required 10 times less power than a conventional system-on-chip or GPU. This introduction marked a shift towards creating more energy-efficient hardware solutions for AI, an important consideration as energy costs and environmental impacts become more of a concern (Sharma, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cadence\n",
    "Following the excitement of AI powered chip design in June, July brought the release of the Cerebrus platform from Cadence. The Cerebrus Intelligent Chip Explorer tool leverages ML to enhance the process of chip design, making engineers remarkably more productive. The introduction of ML has added an additional layer of automation to the design process, resulting in up to 10 times improved productivity per engineer and yielding a 20% enhancement in power, performance, and chip area (Takahashi, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SambaNova Systems\n",
    "In August SambaNova Systems, another popular chip startup, announced a unique Dataflow architecture, a high-performance and high-accuracy hardware-software system designed for AI applications​. The Dataflow architecture is powered by its innovative Cardinal SN10 reconfigureable data unit chip boasting an incredible 300 TeraFLOPS and up to 150 TB/s on-chip memory bandwidth. These high-speed compute capabilities are particularly relevant in the context of ML and AI (Kennedy, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tenstorrent\n",
    "Canadian based startup Tenstorrent released their flagship Grayskull processor into production in late 2020. It was not until Hot Chips 33 in August that it got its true debut. The Grayskull is referred to as an \"all-in-one\" computer system. In preliminary experiments, the system hit 368 TeraOPS and had been observed processing up to 23,345 sentences per second using Google’s BERT-Base language model for the SQuAD 1.1 data set, giving it a 26 times performance advantage over existing solutions (Wiggers, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apple\n",
    "In October, Apple further upgraded the M1 series chips—released just a year prior and hailed as Apple's most powerful chips. The M1 Pro and M1 Max chips featured a standard but enhanced 16-core NPU for better on-device ML, highlighting Apple's focus on integrating ML in their products (\"Introducing M1 Pro and M1 Max,\" 2021). Although not a traditional AI pioneer, Apple is emphasizing Edge AI, deploying AI applications on physical devices rather than relying on centralized cloud servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS\n",
    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued hardware announcements during their annual Re:Invent conference in November. Among these was the third generation of their Graviton hardware, Graviton3. This latest version is three times faster for ML workloads and up to a 60% energy saving compared to other leading hardware, giving it the \"best price-performance ratio in Amazon EC2\" (Nikita, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groq\n",
    "Although not released in 2021, the startup called Groq, received significant of attention in late 2021 when it announced that their flagship GroqChip or Groq tensor streaming processor (TSP) was used for COVID drug discovery at Argonne National Laboratory. They showed a 333-fold speed improvement compared to legacy GPUs at the time (Westfall, 2021). This chip is highly specialized for ML workloads and not much else, capable of 1 PetaOPS performance on a single chip implementation (Garanhel, 2022)."

    "### Nvidia\n",
    "In March, Nvidia announced the release of their general-purpose GPU server station lineup, DGX-1, and DGX-2 built on state-of-the-art Volta GPU architecture (Gupta, 2022). The system includes the DGX A100, which is a single server system featuring multiple A100 GPUs. Since 2020, the A100 has served as the industry standard for GPU hardware, which often prompts comparison when new hardware is released. Nvidia also announced the release of the H100 data center GPU, built with the new Hopper architecture with scalable speed in exchange for lower numerical accuracy. All these components are specifically designed for deep learning training, accelerated analytics, and inference (Fu, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "Only one year after Google published their research into AI chip design, Nvidia announced their own incorporation of AI called 'PrefixRL'. Similar methods of reinforcement learning were incorporated into their new Hopper architecture resulting in circuits 25% smaller than those designed by humans (Roy, Raiman, & Godil, 2023). In late 2022 Nvidia announced major upgrades to their consumer GPU, the new GeoForce 40 series (Walton, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apple\n",
    "In March and June, Apple announced the M1 Ultra and M2 chip, both next-generation enhancements of their breakthrough M1 chip. The M1 ultra contained the greatest number of transistors ever on a personal computer. The new mac standard NPU in M2 is approximately 40% faster than the prior year in every category (\"Apple unveils M2,\" 2022). These advancements showed Apples continued emphasis for on-device ML and more consistent performance across all types of Apple devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intel\n",
    "In May, Intel’s Habana Labs released the second generation of their deep learning processors for training and inference — Habana Gaudi2. Initial results show quicker training times for BERT in MLPerf benchmarks (Gupta, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cadence\n",
    "In June, Cadence announced that customer adoption of the Cerebrus platform was growing. They shared that a company called MediaTek, who powers more than two billion connected devices around the world, has integrated Cerebrus into production.  (Business Wire, 2022). Cadence also launched JedAI, a platform that integrates the various specialized AI hardware phase design products into one platform (Freund, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### HPE and AMD\n",
    "June marked a groundbreaking collaboration between HPE and AMD, resulting in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announcing the Frontier supercomputer, which is powered by AMD hardware. Notably, the Frontier is the world's first officially recognized exascale supercomputer, having sustained 1.102 ExaFLOPS on 64-bit operations during an early benchmark test. Impressively, initial evaluations have recognized the Frontier's architecture as the world's most power-efficient and have dubbed it the \"fastest AI system on the planet\" (Alcorn, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### IBM and Tokyo Electron\n",
    "In July, IBM and Tokyo Electron made strides in 3D chip stacking by addressing the limitations posed by Moore's law. Silicon carrier wafers, a significant obstacle in 3D chip manufacturing, were at the core of their challenges. The advancements they have introduced are designed to optimize the production process, with the added advantage of potentially alleviating the global chip shortage (Peckham, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Untether AI\n",
    "In August, Untether AI introduced a device codenamed 'Boqueria,' also known as SpeedAI240. This device is designed to enhance energy efficiency and density, allowing scalability for devices of different sizes. Scalability of chip performance proves useful when working with language models of varying parameter sizes (Burt, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tesla\n",
    "On AI Day in September, Tesla revealed its powerful Dojo chip, designed for faster training and inference in self-driving cars. The Dojo chip is so powerful that it \"tripped the power grid in Palo Alto\" (Lambert, 2022). Tesla claims that one Dojo chip can replace six GPUs. The Dojo chip is expected to increase Tesla’s ability to train neural nets using video data, which is in high demand in their self-driving car initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SambaNova Systems\n",
    "In October, SambaNova Systems announced the shipping of the second generation of the DataScale system—SN30. The system, powered by the Cardinal SN30 chip, is built for large models with more than 100 billion (B) parameters and capable of handling both 2D and 3D images (Fu, 2022). The DataScale SN30, eight SN30 chips, boasts six times faster GPT training than the Nvidia DGX A100 system (Butler, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS\n",
    "In October, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances, which are powered by AWS Trainium chips, built specifically for training high-performance ML applications in the cloud. Trn1 instances claimed up to a 50% cost savings over comparable GPU-based EC2 instances for training LLMs (AWS, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "A month later, at AWS Re:Invent 2022, Amazon made the EC2 Inf2 powered by the AWS Inferentia2 generally available. This ML accelerator, optimized for inference, offers larger compute density enabling lower cost per query. Inf2 also boasts the ability to deploy a 175B parameter model, such as GPT-3, on a single server. These two chip architectures represent a shift from using general purpose hardware to using hardware custom-built to the specific phase of the system in order to lower task-specific compute costs (Liu, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cerebras\n",
    "In November, Cerebras Systems launched their AI supercomputer, Andromeda, aiming to accelerate academic and commercial research (Gupta, 2022). Cerebras emphasized a concept called 'near-perfect linear scaling.' This means that when the system's resources are doubled, for instance by using two WSE-2 chips instead of one, the performance or speed of processing can also be expected to double (Hall, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### IBM\n",
    "November also marked the launch of IBM's AIU chip. This unique chip confines GPU floating point operations to 8-bit, less precise than even a CPU with higher compute density and similar model accuracy. Furthermore, it demands less power and memory compared to other top-tier GPUs with identical measures. The primary advantage lies in its affordability. Priced around \\$1,000 per chip, a set of 10 AIUs could rival the performance of the Nvidia H100 GPU, which ranges from \\$20,000 to \\$30,000. IBM believes this platform will make model training 1,000 times faster by 2030 (Morgan, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI\n",
    "OpenAI's November release of ChatGPT underscored the key role of hardware in AI performance. Training the GPT-3 on 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs facilitated managing the 175B parameters and 45 TB dataset in a reasonable time. Moreover, real-time inference demands powerful servers for model hosting and efficient hardware for quick request processing. Despite high upfront costs, their large-scale infrastructure setup enables a low per query cost of 0.36 cents (Patel & Ahmad, 2023). However, at around \\$10,000 a piece for each GPU it is estimated that the training cost for GPT-3 was around \\$4 million (Vanian & Leswing, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with the April release of DALLE-2, OpenAI's upgraded image generation tool. DALLE-2 uses a technique called 'stable diffusion' which eliminated the need to train GPT-3. A recent report suggested that the training of DALLE-2 only required a cluster of 256 A100 GPUs and 150,000 hours of training which equates to about \\$600,000 (Bastian, 2022). The downside is that training stable diffusion requires more training data. DALLE-2 is a significant example of how a simplified model architecture enabled greater efficiency without a change in GPU type."

    "### Apple, Google, and Microsoft\n",
    "The 2023 developer conferences from Apple, Google, and Microsoft gave a preview of the types of advancements coming in the second half of the year and beyond. Google I/O, Microsoft Build, and Apple WWDC each highlighted primarily software upgrades that indicate the companies priorities. Microsoft is fully embracing and participating in the AI race with new virtual assistants, product features, Azure Supercomputer, and open LLMs (Porter, 2023). Many were surprised at the lack of a TPUv5 announcement at Google I/O given that it has been acknowledged to exist back in 2021 (Shah, 2023). Apple, a bit more withdrawn from the hype surrounding AI, did not once mention the term \"artificial intelligence\" at WWDC (Greenburg, 2023). Instead, they unveiled numerous software improvements for ML across the device ecosystem along with the upgraded M2 Ultra's 32-core NPU touted as 40% faster than the prior year. (\"Apple introduces M2 Ultra,\" 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synopsis and Cadence\n",
    "AI assisted chip design has resurfaced as a more popular option for manufacturers. Although there have not been any significant announcements made so far in 2023 regarding AI designed chips, Synopsys and Cadence have reported higher adoption of their intelligent design software. Specifically in February, Synopsys reported that it had reached 100 commercial \"tapeouts\" or 100 chips that are being used in commercial products (Ward-Foxton, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groq\n",
    "In March, Groq gained the spotlight by claiming that it had created a process to move Meta's LLaMA from Nvidia chips over to its own hardware signaling a potential threat to Nvidia's 90% GPU market share. The complexity of the current AI hardware makes it a tedious task to adapt model architectures to run quickly on new setups (Lee & Nellis, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nvidia\n",
    "The International Supercomputing Conference in May featured several major announcements from Nvidia. Their Grace CPU Superchips, now integrated into the UK-based Isambard 3 supercomputer, provides superior speed and memory bandwidth with its 55,000+ core count. These benefits stem from the incorporation of Arm Neoverse V2 cores (Kennedy, 2023). Nvidia's DGX GH200 supercomputer is powered by a combination of the new Grace Hopper 200 GPU and the Grace CPU, with features like 144 TB of shared memory, marking an almost 500-fold increase compared to the previous generation DGX A100. A standard cluster of 256 such configurations offers a staggering 1 ExaFLOP (Edwards, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intel\n",
    "In May, Intel announcing embedded Vision Processing Units (VPUs) across all variants of Meteor Lake chips, thereby offloading AI processing tasks from the CPU and GPU to the VPU. This move resulted in increased power efficiency and ability to manage complex AI models, providing benefits for power-hungry applications such as Adobe suite, Microsoft Teams, and Unreal Engine (Roach, 2023). Intel also introduced the fourth generation Xeon processors with ten times speed improvement for PyTorch training/inference. The update Xeon series offers optimized models for high-performance, low-latency networks and edge workloads (Smith, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meta\n",
    "Meta made its leap into AI hardware in May by unveiling its first custom-designed chips, the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) and the Meta Scalable Video Processor (MSVP). These chips, optimized for deep learning and video processing, underpin Meta's plans for a next-gen data center optimized for AI, illustrating its dedication to crafting a fully integrated AI ecosystem (Khare, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AMD\n",
    "AMD introduced an AI chip in June called MI300X, described as \"the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI\" (Mohan, 2023). This introduction was expected to compete head-on with Nvidia's AI chips and generated interest from major cloud providers. Simultaneously, AMD initiated high-volume shipping of a general-purpose central processor chip named \"Bergamo\", adopted by Meta Platforms and others for their computing infrastructure (Mohan, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inflection AI\n",
    "In July, the startup Inflection AI, which aims to create a \"personal AI for everyone,\" made a major announcement in their quest to develop a chatbot called \"Pi\". The company plans to equip an AI supercomputer with 22,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. This supercomputer could allow their infastructure to compete with the AMD Frontier supercomputer and enable significant improvements to their 'Inflection 1' LLM. Interestingly, the key point of discussion is not so much the computing power itself, but whether Nvidia can meet such a substantial GPU order. This comes amid recent reports suggesting difficulties in acquiring even a single H100 unit in addition to the ongoing chip shortage (Zuhair, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### More To Come\n",
    "While the advancements thus far in 2023 are significant, it is important to note that the main AI Hardware conferences such as AI Hardware Summit, AWS Re:Invent, Hot Chips, and others are yet to occur. As of July 2023, there is not a full picture of all the developments in the field for 2023. As such, the information about the current state of AI hardware in 2023 is still limited."

    "The late 2022 release of OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked a surge in AI advancements over the following six months, primarily fueled by an increased demand for hardware related to generative AI and LLMs. The competitive landscape, featuring key players like Google's Bard powered by PaLM 2, Microsoft's Bing AI, and Meta's LLaMA, were driven by the rapid development of LLMs in response to an explosion of demand. Training quality LLMs required the most advanced AI hardware; however, hardware is just one facet of product development. Choices about parameter and data size critically shape the design, affecting everything from hardware requirements to training duration and model performance. For instance, the implications of choosing 175B parameters for OpenAI's GPT-3, 1.8 trillion for GPT-4, versus LLaMA's 65B parameters are considerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surge in demand from LLMs and other generative AI applications has disrupted the GPU market because these sectors have not been included in historical market projections. The resulting shortage has prevented GPUs from becoming less expensive, which has further impeded the entry of smaller companies into the market and inhibited the widespread adoption of acceleration hardware. The heightened demand even creates challenges for cutting-edge companies like OpenAI, who are experiencing deployment bottlenecks due to GPU shortages. This scarcity is the reason only 37% of the 500 most powerful computer systems globally are using GPUs. This indicates that the industry is leaning towards alternative solutions for desired computational power, emphasizing other system components such as CPU-only solutions or innovative use of integrated GPUs (Eadline, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "This fast-paced advancement towards advanced AI has stirred up a wide range of perspectives within the AI community on the long-term outlook. On one hand, prominent technology figures like Geoffrey Hinton, Elon Musk, and Eric Schmidt urge caution, highlighting ethical and long-term existential risks (Gairola, 2023). On the other hand, other prominent AI advocates such as Andrew Ng see the potential of superior AI driving unprecedented advancements and solving global challenges (Cherney, 2023). As these modern figures grapple with uncertainty regarding AI development, the pioneers of this field also reflected deeply on the implications of machine advancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting on the pace of technological progress following the Industrial Revolution and recent publication of Darwin's 'Origin of Species', Samuel Butler (1863) expressed this observation in his essay, \"There is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now... Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing.\" Butler's words highlight the staggering speed of machine evolution, especially when compared to the slow, incremental changes seen in biological organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Years later, Alan Turing echoed these sentiments. Turing (1951) reflected on the unpredictable nature of the technological advancements of his time, asserting, \"We can see plenty there that needs to be done, and although we can make some fairly reliable, though quite rough, guesses, based on past experience, as to the order in which these developments will come, there remains the possibility that any one particular piece of research may lead to consequences of a revolutionary character.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not machines will surpass human intelligence is an age-old question. The difference between the hype experienced now versus the 1970's is that we have the compute capability to keep up with the hype, suggesting that we are not in a bubble that would lead to another \"AI Winter\". As illustrated in Figure 12, a recent report from ARK Investment Management LLC (ARK) shows that Neural Networks, and subsequent training, have the most influential potential as a catalyst for a host of other technologies(ARK, 2023). Equally important, although not directly illustrated in the figure, is the process of training these networks, which by necessity accompanies their development and is a significant catalyst."

    "Despite the forecasted lower cost to train existing models like GPT-3, model complexity has already evolved far beyond this model that initially powered ChatGPT. As stated previously, GPT-3 is comprised of 175B parameters and was trained on 45 TB of data. The successor released in March 2023, GPT-4, contains 1.8 trillion parameters and was trained on 1 PB of data (E2Analyst, 2023). Any improvements in training cost for GPT-3 are now irrelevant due to the higher cost of data and much larger parameter size. A recent report by OpenAI analyzed training cost of recent AI models, such as GPT-4, and found that the cost of training is increasing exponentially as shown in Figure 14. The data shows that the cost of training a model is expected to rise to $500 million by 2030 (Cottier, 2023)."

    "The years since 2021 have proven to be historic for the development of AI-specific hardware, marking a notable departure from traditional computing paradigms. Advancements in processing and acceleration hardware are not solely about boosting raw performance or adhering strictly to Moore's Law's transistor-doubling prediction. Experimentation has been key during this period, leading to numerous technological breakthroughs, as well as a newfound understanding that incorporation of an expensive GPU does not guarantee success. Instead, the industry has shifted its focus towards specializing the GPU architecture for the required tasks such as training or inference, optimizing other components of the computer architecture, or building more specialized models to reduce hardware demand. The specialization of different components has led to experimentation with other architectures such as 3D chip stacking and \"neuromorphic\" chips designed to mimic the structure of the human brain (University of California - San Diego, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "This paradigm shift is further emphasized by the rise of benchmarks like MLPerf. These are not simply nice-to-have performance metrics anymore; they are vital indicators of technological progress in AI. Rarely does a new CPU or GPU announcement come without some indication of MLPerf performance. These benchmarks reflect the nuanced performance characteristics of various AI workloads and provide invaluable context for ML practitioners. This paradigm shift is further emphasized by the rise of benchmarks like MLPerf. These are not simply nice-to-have performance metrics anymore; they are vital indicators of technological progress in AI. Rarely does a new CPU or GPU announcement come without some indication of MLPerf performance. These benchmarks reflect the nuanced performance characteristics of various AI workloads and provide invaluable context for ML practitioners. However, critics of MLPerf indicate that it is not comprehensive enough to capture the entire end-to-end lifecycle of an AI application. With only eight benchmark tests, manufacturers may be focusing too narrowly on training and inference while ignoring other crucial tasks for compute resources, such as data loading, model serving, and edge computing (Bunting, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the criticisms, this culture of benchmarking has provided reassurance for the future of computing, dispelling any illusions of an impending \"AI Bubble\" akin to the 1970s and confirming that AI is firmly entrenched in our technological landscape. This recent period of advancements has tangible reductions in cost, widespread adoption of AI applications, and steady improvements in hardware capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important takeaways is the realization that more acceleration power is not the sole determinant of AI system performance. The evolution of LLMs like ChatGPT and other specialized models has clearly demonstrated that the true potential of AI is unleashed when there is harmony between the data, hardware, and the software that is specifically optimized for that hardware. This recognition has redefined the approach to AI development, democratizing access to intelligent systems, and broadening the AI audience. Product design decisions increasingly reflect this understanding, with flexibility catering to consumer needs taking precedence over rigid accelerators designed to manage specific problem types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this time period has highlighted that hardware is no longer the most restrictive bottleneck of AI performance. As AI algorithms become more efficient and hardware continues to advance, the challenges faced in harnessing the full potential of AI lie elsewhere. Issues such as data size, availability, quality, hardware power efficiency, and system integration are moving to the forefront. Ultimately, the advancements in AI acceleration hardware since 2021 have greatly enriched the ML community, enabling practitioners to achieve what was recently thought to be impossible. These developments will continue to empower model developers, enhance productivity, and illuminate new areas of research ripe for exploration. This begs the question: what perceived impossibilities will become possible by 2025?"
